Raw text: Nikolas Molyndris (2:18 AM): The 01 Project [link: openinterpreter.com]. It came out about a week ago and feels a bit like vaporware. Nikolas Molyndris (2:18 AM): Also, these might seem like snake oil, but in the enterprise world, they count as leverage. If you want, give me an email, and I'll send you some more long-form thoughts I had. I'll include the papers I mentioned as well. [GleanGlean Post]: We're thrilled to be part of McKinsey & Company's enterprise generative AI ecosystem, helping companies navigate the complexities of adopting and scaling generative AI. [McKinsey & Company Post]: About 90% of all generative AI pilots fail to reach full production. We're excited to announce our ecosystem of strategic alliances, offering clients distinctive expertise and solutions across the technology stack. Alex Mavrogiannis (1:14 PM): Good evening Niko, it was great meeting you yesterday. I'd love to continue our conversation whenever you have time. My email is almavrog@gmail.com - feel free to send me your papers and thoughts! Alex Mavrogiannis (1:17 PM): If you have time next week, I'd be happy to catch up. Here's my Calendly link [calendly link], and I'm also near Chalandri if you want to meet in person. Nikolas Molyndris (1:53 PM): Good morning! I'd suggest meeting in person one afternoon if you can, but from next week since I'll be in Zurich for work. In the meantime, I'll do a little write-up today or Wednesday on the plane with a clearer mind. Check these out in the meantime; I found them interesting [links to arXiv papers]. Alex Mavrogiannis (9:53 PM): Thank you very much, the last one is particularly interesting for our approach. Nikolas Molyndris (11:50 PM): Really? For me, that was more of an "FYI", as I understood it was more for on-screen reference. Nikolas Molyndris (11:52 PM): Also, you're aware of this, I assume [link to PrivateGPT documentation]. Alex Mavrogiannis (11:54 PM): We're closely monitoring local screen capture copilots (e.g., rewind.ai) as a similar market segment, but currently, we're not aiming for an implementation in that direction. Nikolas Molyndris (11:58 PM): I was thinking more along the lines of having an architecture with two quantized (and pruned?) Mistral running in an agentic structure and fitting into an M1 Pro. Alex Mavrogiannis (11:58 PM): We're aware of PrivateGPT, as well as [links to similar services], which are similar in implementation (with differences in positioning). All three are containerized apps with considerable deployment config for local - we're aiming to try with native Mac packages. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:01 AM): Very likely, for now, we're focusing on onboarding and connectors for ingestion and not so much on resource utilization or model efficiency. We believe the hardest problem right now is access control for the context, while the choice of LLMs will change over time. Nikolas Molyndris (12:08 AM): Fair. I saw an interesting piece of work that had a knowledge graph layer as an intermediate memory but don't know where that went. I'd like to hear more about the user story you have in mind. As you might have guessed, I've also spent some time in this field. I even had a chat with your [text, video, sound] library when the GPT-4 API was released with Langchain, so you could bounce some ideas off me. From next Monday, any afternoon works for me. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:17 AM): Was he planning to make it a product, or build it as an internal tool within his company? I'm also available from next Monday; let's confirm within the week. Nikolas Molyndris (12:20 AM): The latter. Though he was a bit of a "yes man," so I don't know if he actually went through with it, but certainly, many will try on their own. Including in enterprises. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:21 AM): Could you possibly make us an intro? I'd very much like to ask him what would or wouldn't work for his use case Nikolas Molyndris (12:21 AM): I'll write to you about how I see the data analysis landscape for security-conscious enterprises, and we can discuss it more in person. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:21 AM): Fair enough, I look forward to it. Nikolas Molyndris (12:22 AM): I'll reach out to him to see what he ended up doing and if he's still interested in the topic, I'll make an introduction. Nikolas Molyndris (12:23 AM): I also know someone working at a PR agency here who had a use case (not sure how realistic), but they don't have a security problem; they just don't know about Glean and what it does. Nikolas Molyndris (12:26 AM): I've talked to many about this because I thought it would be a huge productivity boost and wanted to understand which use cases it could fit. What I've understood is that few are comfortable with chat as an interface for various reasons (which I can elaborate on in a more extensive conversation). That's why I am/was more bullish on agentic software. Check this out if you can: "OpenAI Shifts AI Battleground to Software That Operates Devices, Automates Tasks" [theinformation.com]. That's why I sent you the open interpreter. But these are just my unqualified two cents at 12:30 AM ðŸ˜‚ Alex Mavrogiannis (12:28 AM): I agree, but currently, the performance of agents isn't sufficient, and there's a significant need for human in the loop. If we can solve the issue of sensitive data ingestion, it could be one of many interfaces/apps. Nikolas Molyndris (12:29 AM): Are you referring to local? What sticks with me is that you need different models for an LLM OS, as Karpathy mentioned, and another for Q&A over docs. But I'm listening to what you're saying. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:30 AM): Either way, Glean also has multiple interfaces (chatbot/feed/agents) over the same ingested data. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:32 AM): The idea of an LLM OS probably goes closer to what we mentioned before with screen capture like rewind.ai, not an unlikely possibility for expansion but quite different from the enterprise play we're looking at right now. Nikolas Molyndris (12:36 AM): Fair enough, as I said, just my two cents and "outside looking in." Nikolas Molyndris (12:38 AM): Also, I believe the most modern idea for an LLM OS isn't based on screen capture; I think it goes deeper, but I don't want to spread inaccuracies, so I won't say more. Nikolas Molyndris (12:39 AM): Finally, for bottom-up in enterprise, keep in mind that what I've seen is that it needs to be a "pincer movement" and not just bottom-up because otherwise, you're at a disadvantageâ€”unless you're incredibly sticky. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:40 AM): Sooner or later, we'll need to do top-down, but we hope the OSS & desktop combo will work for distribution GTM. Nikolas Molyndris (12:41 AM): What I've seen in real life, both in my own product and in clients (enterprise), is that when it's productivity tooling for NON-developers, the sway that users have is minimalâ€”but with many caveats, of course. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:42 AM): Possibly, that's why we're also looking for real-life prospective users to learn from :) Nikolas Molyndris (12:44 AM): I've done a lot of product exploration in enterprise, got a couple of tips we can talk about. It's a run but fun. I ran an interview campaign where I spoke with 200 data scientists about our product. Nikolas Molyndris (12:46 AM): Anyway, I'm off to bed because I have to wake up early, but we'll talk during the week about the meeting if you want. I'll also reach out to the guy who mentioned the case to see if he wants to talk. Alex Mavrogiannis (12:47 AM): Thanks a lot for your thoughts and attention, good night, and we'll talk. Nikolas Molyndris (12:47 AM): Good night!
