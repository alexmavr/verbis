Despite their allur-\ning technological potential, there is no unified and comprehensive evaluation\ncriterion, leading to the inability to evaluate the quality and potential risks of\nmedical LLMs, further hindering the application of LLMs in medical treatment\nscenarios. Besides, current evaluations heavily rely on labor-intensive interactions\nwith LLMs to obtain diagnostic dialogues and human evaluation on the quality\nof diagnosis dialogue.\nMethods: To tackle the lack of unified and comprehensive evaluation criterion,\nwe first initially establish an evaluation criterion, termed LLM-specific Mini-CEX\nto assess the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs effectively, based on original Mini-\nCEX. To address the labor-intensive interaction problem, we develop a patient\nsimulator to engage in automatic conversations with LLMs, and utilize ChatGPT\nfor evaluating diagnosis dialogues automatically.\n1arXiv:2308.07635v1  [cs.CL]  15 Aug 2023', 'Results: Experimental results show that the LLM-specific Mini-CEX is adequate\nand necessary to evaluate medical diagnosis dialogue. Besides, ChatGPT can\nreplace manual evaluation on the metrics of humanistic qualities and provides\nreproducible and automated comparisons between different LLMs.\nKeywords: Large language model, Medical diagnostic conversation, Automatic\nEvaluation, Mini-CEX\n1 Introduction\nThelargelanguage models (LLMs) [1–4], owing to their abilities to generate human-\nlike responses by learning from tremendous online resources, have shown great\npotential in various medical applications, such as medical education [5], medical\nQA [6, 7], and medical diagnosis [8]. Among these applications, using LLMs for medical\ndiagnosis to enhance the decision-making process treatment efficiency [8] has gained\nattention as LLMs could answer some medical queries as well as clinicians [6, 9]. How-\never, LLMs may produce generations misaligned with clinical and societal value [10].\nTo facilitate the application of LLMs for medical diagnosis in real clinical scenar-\nios, it is crucial to evaluate LLMs’ capability and mitigate potential risks, due to the\nsafety-critical nature of the medical domain.\nTowards the evaluation of LLMs’ capabilities in the medical domain, current\nevaluation methods can be divided into three kinds, which are medical information\nextraction (IE), medical question-and- answer (QA), and diagnosis dialogue capabil-\nity evaluation. Specifically, the medical IE aims to extract pre-specified information\nfrom medical textual sources and the medical QA focuses on the single round med-\nical knowledge QA. However, the evaluations on medical IE and QA is insufficient\nfor the evaluation of LLMs’ diagnostic capabilities in real clinical scenarios as they\nneglect either multi-turn diagnostic interviewing or rigorous diagnostic results, as\nshown in Table 1. Compared with medical IE and QA, the evaluation of medical diag-\nnosis dialogue can better reflect the diagnostic capability. However, current metrics\nfor evaluation of medical diagnosis dialogue are all word-based methods [11–14], mea-\nsuring the word co-occurrence between predicted results and ground-truth references,\nthus failing to judge the medical diagnostic quality due to the complexity of natural\nlanguage. Therefore, there is a great demand for designing a unified and comprehen-\nsive evaluation criterion for evaluating LLMs’ diagnostic capability in real clinical\napplications.\nInspired by the Mini- clinical evaluation exercise (Mini-CEX) [15, 16], a formative\nassessment tool designed to evaluate the ability of doctors to provide clinical care in\nactual medical consultations [17], we propose to construct LLM-specific Mini-CEX for\nevaluating LLMs’ diagnostic capabilities. Specifically, in the original Mini-CEX, physi-\ncians are evaluated on six aspects: medical interviewing skills, physical examination\nskills, professionalism, counselling skills, clinical judgement, and organisation/effi-\nciency [15, 17]. However, the original Mini-CEX can not be directly applied to LLMs,\ndue to a lack of physical observations, palpations, and access to laboratory testing in\n2']","There is a need for a unified evaluation criterion in evaluating LLMs' diagnostic capabilities in real clinical applications because current evaluation methods are insufficient.

What does factuality in large language models refer to?,"['4 Wang, et al.\nissue and the factuality issues in Sec 2.2. Moreover, these surveys often overlook key areas we\nemphasize, like domain-specific factuality or the challenge of outdated information. While Ling\net al. [149] explores domain specialization in LLMs, our survey takes a more expansive look at the\nbroader issues of factuality. To the best of our understanding, our work is the first comprehensive\nstudy on the factuality of large language models.\nThis survey aims to offer an exhaustive overview of the factuality studies in LLMs, delving\ninto four key dimensions: Sec 2) The definition and impact of the factuality issue [ 190,207];\nSec 3) Techniques for evaluating factuality and its quantitative assessment [ 105,180]; Sec 4)\nAnalyzing the underlying mechanisms of factuality in LLMs and identifying the root causes of\nfactual errors [ 126,154]; and Sec 5) Approaches to enhance the factuality of LLMs [ 58,92]. Notably,\nwe categorize the use of LLMs into two primary settings: LLMs without external knowledge, such\nas ChatGPT [ 192] and Retrieval-Augmented LLMs, such as BingChat [ 177]. The complete structure\nof this survey is illustrated in Figure 1. Through a detailed examination of existing research, we\nseek to shed light on this critical aspect of LLMs, helping researchers, developers, and users harness\nthe power of these models responsibly and effectively.\n2 FACTUALITY ISSUE\nIn this section, we describe the issue of factuality in large language models, as well as the impact.\n2.1 Large Language Models\nThere is no well-accepted and exact definition of large language models in the literature [ 21,101,312].\nWe mainly consider the decoder-only generative pre-trained language modes with emergent abilities,\nsuch as ChatGPT [ 192] and LLaMA [ 254,255]. We also include some work that is based on models\nwith encoder-decoder architectures, such as T5 [ 213].

What challenges did participants face due to the vocabulary problem when crafting prompts for LLMs?,"['IUI ’24, March 18–21, 2024, Greenville, SC, USA Khurana et al.\nFigure 4: LLM Hallucination evidence (P15): In response to P15’s prompt, “I want you to give me instructions on how to animate\na shape that rotates from top to lower middle side and then come back up almost like a zigzag.”, Baseline ChatGPT generated\nthe hallucinated response of Zigzag menu option (highlighted in red) which did not even exist in the software application.\nappropriate prompts and applying LLM assistance for different\nsoftware tasks.\n4.2 Inconsistency in Prompt-based Interaction\nPrompt guidelines and prompt engineers usually suggest that break-\ning down the task and prompting it as a process for LLM can usu-\nally lead to desired LLM outputs. However, with the exception of 2\nparticipants in our study who followed this approach and were suc-\ncessful (See example of Participant P02 in Figure 6), all of the other\nparticipants were inconsistent and varied in how they constructed\nprompts, failing to leverage the in-context prompt guidelines.\nConstructing Prompts as Search Queries: Most participants\n(10/16) started with a generic “how to do the [task] ” prompt, such as\n(e.g., “how to animate in Microsoft PowerPoint” (P14), “ how to do\ncorrelation in Microsoft excel ” (P04)). Most users were translating\ntheir mental model from other query-based systems, relying on\nsimilar queries they would issue on Google: “I think it [LLM] relies\non the keywords that I am giving...at the beginning I just formulated\na very vague question because it’s easier to get started with the vague\nquestion and then I can refine it as I go. ” (P08)\nEven after users experimented with different phrasings, they\ncould not understand why the LLMs were producing nearly identi-\ncal responses. These participants did not have an accurate mental\nmodel of how LLMs work and did not appear to recognize the im-\npact of the prompt text on the quality of the LLM output: “ I think it\nworks same as a search engine. It has a back end and it takes your\nquestion through tons of data...it tries to give you an answer with\nall of that data that it has in the back end..it’s so quick that it goes\nthrough it within nanoseconds.. ” (P15)\nSome participants (4/16), without even interpreting the task,\njust copy-pasted the entire task instructions along with some data\nsample (e.g., for Excel tasks) in hopes that the LLM would simplify\nthe task and provide some instructions. However, both of these\napproaches were not that successful (as shown in Figure 5), as users\nhad to ask follow-up questions on figuring out the correct steps.\nFor example, when P07 (Figure 5) prompted the LLM using the\nkeywords interpreted from the task, they struggled in getting an\nrelevant response and went through several rounds of clarifications\nwith the LLM. Only 2/16 participants who broke down the task and\ndrafted prompts as a process for SoftAIBot LLM obtained desired\nLLM outputs (See example of P02 in Figure 6)Using Trial and Error Due to the Vocabulary Problem: The\nmajority of participants (11/16) also struggled in crafting prompts\nbecause they did not know how to express their task intent us-\ning software-specific terminology (often termed as the vocabulary\nproblem [ 16]). This was especially prevalent during the PowerPoint\ntasks that involved references to different visual and interactive\nelements and participants frequently engaged in long trial-and-\nerror episodes. Participants found it challenging to articulate their\nintended actions accurately and frequently blamed themselves: “I\ndid not know how to describe those visual graphics in PowerPoint...I\nsaid words like flip and move but I am not sure if it was right for\nthese kind of tasks . It took me a lot of time to try to understand which\nmenu to select and not being sure if my prompt was ok or not. . . If the\nproblem was my prompt or my system or the problem was the solu-\ntion provided, I was not sure which one of them was making mistake. ”\n(P05)\nIgnoring Prompt Guidelines: Contrary to our hypothesis,\nonly a handful of participants (5/16) employed the in-context prompt\nguidelines provided by SoftAIBot within the context of their queries\nand the majority simply ignored them. Participants expressed that\nthe prompt guidelines were “not necessary” and “not useful” as it\nwas faster for them to iterate on their own prompts. This behaviour\nwas similar to the phenomenon commonly referred to as the “active\nuser paradox” [ 10]. In fact, about half of the participants (7/16) were\nconfident that they already possess the knowledge and experience\nrequired for generating prompts: “I would not say it is hurtful to have\nit [prompt guidelines] but is not necessary. I knew what to search for.\nI do not think prompt guidelines would have helped. . . ” (P06) Some\nparticipants (4/16) noted that they were confident about crafting\ntheir own prompts because the LLMs were able to accept “any in-\nput” and generate corresponding output. If needed, they can revisit\nthe generated response and assess their prompt alignment with\ntheir intended outcome for further improvement: “It is not difficult\nto figure out words because it [LLM] was accepting anything I typed.\nI can go back and verify whether that is what I need. ” (P11)\n4.3 User Perception of LLM Assistance\nSome of the surprising results from our experiment were that users\ndid not recognize the differences in accuracy and relevance between\nthe two LLMs nor were they able to leverage the assistance to']","Participants faced several challenges due to the vocabulary problem when crafting prompts for LLMs. They struggled to express their task intent using software-specific terminology, especially during PowerPoint tasks involving visual and interactive elements.

Our contributions can be\ncategorized into three main areas:\n•We present both quantitative and qualitative results to assess\nthe proficiency of six different LLMs in solving 26 diverse\nCTF problems. Our findings show that ChatGPT performs\ncomparably to an average-performing human CTF team.\n•We build two workflows for solving CTF questions using\nLLMs and present their success rates.\n•We offer a comprehensive analysis of the typical shortcom-\nings encountered by LLMs when tackling CTF challenges,\nillustrating the limitations of relying solely on LLMs\nwithout human intervention.\nWe make our dataset of challenges and code for the\nautomated solving framework open source to encourage\nuse of LLMs as agents for solving CTF problems: https:\n//github.com/NickNameInvalid/LLM_CTF\n2 Background\n2.1 Capture the Flag (CTF)\nIn the realm of cybersecurity, Capture the Flag (CTF)\nstands out as a distinctive and challenging game, offering an\ninteractive platform for contestants to showcase their security\nskills through practice and education. Originating from a\nclassic outdoor team game where players aim to ‘steal’ flags\nfrom opposing teams, the term ‘Capture the Flag’ has evolved\ninto a cybersecurity concept. CTF competitions simulate real-\nworld security scenarios, incorporating vulnerabilities that can\nbe exploited using state-of-the-art cybersecurity techniques.\nSince the inaugural DEFCON [4] CTF competition in 1993\nin Las Vegas, CTF has gained widespread popularity as a\ncompetitive format in cybersecurity worldwide. There are\ntwo types of CTF challenges: Jeopardy and Attack-Defense.\nJeopardy-style challenges are presented as quizzes, while\nAttack-Defense challenges require contestants to both defend\ntheir own systems and attack others’ systems in a dynamic\nmanner. Modern CTF competitions feature an array of\nquestion types and hacking objectives, catering to a wider\nrange of platforms.\n2.1.1 Application of CTFs\nThe main purpose of CTF competitions is cybersecurity\neducation. CTF organizers provide a vulnerable environment\nthat mimics real-world security concerns to evaluate and\nimprove competitors’ programming skills. Studies havesummarized CTF’s contributions to cultivating cybersecurity\nawareness at various stages of education [22, 32, 36, 39,\n51], starting from secondary school [29] and continuing\nin colleges, in both undergraduate and graduate programs\n[20]. These studies offer perspectives on the advantages\nand difficulties of CTFs as teaching aids. While CTFs can\nenhance learning, their design and execution must be carefully\nconsidered to prevent plagiarism and unfair scoring.\nFurthermore, the application of CTF challenges extends\nbeyond education. [18, 34] focus on mobile application\ndevelopment, proposing systematic guidelines and integrating\nreal-world scenarios through the assistance of CTF games;\n[27] describes the use of CTF competitions in an ethical\nhacking educational activity; [40] uses CTF challenge\nsolutions to assess cybersecurity skills, and [32] explains the\napplication of CTF for team construction in cybersecurity.\nIn light of the growing popularity of LLMs, recent research\n[54] sought to integrate AI systems into CTF tasks using\nthe InterCode [53] benchmark, which aims to benchmark\ninteractive coding using a common framework.\n2.1.2 Problem Categories\nCTF competitions are distinguished by their diverse and\nchallenging problem sets, which are typically categorized\ninto several key areas, each targeting specific skill sets.\n•Crypto(graphy) questions use contemporary, classical, and\neven non-standard encryptions proposed by the questioner.\n•Misc(ellaneous) problems address a variety of security\nideas, including subjects that deal with data analysis, e-\ndiscovery, people search, and traffic analysis.\n•Pwn challenges relate to breaching and gaining access, in\ntopics related to overflow. They assess players’ skills in\nexploit writing, vulnerability mining, and binary reverse\nanalysis. To find vulnerabilities, contestants debug and\nreverse engineer compiled executable files. They create\nexploit code to execute overflow attacks remotely, obtaining\nshell access to the target machine to capture the flag.\n•Web security topics include common web vulnerabilities\nsuch as injection, XSS, file inclusion, and code execution\nthat can be fixed by contestants using packet sniffing and\nnetwork protocol exploiting skills.\n•Forensics challenges are designed to resemble real-world\ncybercrime investigations. Players examine digital data\nsuch as corrupted files and network captures to uncover\ninformation that is hidden, or to trace a cyberattack.\n•Rev(erse Engineering) techniques for software reversal\nand cracking are the focus of this class of problems.\nAttackers use tools like Ollydbg, IDA Pro, and PEiD for\nbasic reverse analysis and program password recovery using\ndynamic debugging and static analysis.\n•Steg(anography) flags are concealed from participants\nusing data carriers such as audio, video, and image.\n2']",The main purpose of CTF competitions is cybersecurity education.

Nevertheless, the underlying\nmechanisms by which the model itself process di-\nverse languages at the composition level continue\nto be an area of vigorous investigation.\nTo develop a deeper understanding of the mul-\ntilingual capabilities of LLMs, we draw inspira-\ntion from the neurobiological underpinnings of\nhuman language faculties (Friederici, 2011; Parr\net al., 2022; Khanna et al., 2024).

What are some future research directions for enhancing LLMs for domain-specific tasks in building energy efficiency and decarbonization studies?,"['5 Future Research Directions  \n5.1 Enhancing LLMs for Domain -Specific Tasks \nFuture research can focus on enhancing LLMs for domain -specific tasks in building energy efficiency and \ndecarbonization  studies. While LLMs are already capable of processing and analyzing large amounts of \ndata, further improvements can be made to tailor them to specific tasks in this field.  \nAn essential trajectory for forthcoming research centers around delineating the most suitable approach \namong fine -tuning, prompt engineering, or semantic search for distinct tasks. Rather than universally \napplying a single method, the optimal strategy may vary based on the specific requirements and nuances \nof each challenge. For instance, tasks demanding deep domain knowledge might benefit most from fine -\ntuning, where the model is further refined on specialized datasets. Wu et al. [11] developed BloombergGPT, \nthe first specialized LLM for the financial domain . BloombergGPT is a language model with 50 billion \nparameters, trained using an extensive variety of financial data . The concept of creating a similar model \nsuch as ""BuildingEnergyGPT"" is intriguing. However, the contexts in which we deploy it warrant thoughtful \nconsideration.  In contrast, scenarios requiring a broader understanding without deep specialization might \nbe aptly tackled through prompt engineering, optimizing the way LLMs  interact with and interpret a given \nquestion or data set. Meanwhile, when the priority is swiftly locating relevant insights within vast data \nreservoirs, semantic search could emerge as the most efficacious tool.  In essence, discerning the best -fit \nmethod for each task will be crucial, not only to maximize the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs but also to \nensure that they remain versatile and adaptive across a spectrum of challenges.   \nFuture directions in Enhancing LLMs for domain -specific tasks  in this field include: 1) Specialized Training \nDatasets  for LLM Fine -Tuning : Curate and develop domain -specific datasets enriched with building energy \nefficiency and decarbonization  knowledge. These datasets can be used to fine -tune models like \n""BuildingEnergyGPT"" to enhance their specificity and relevance , 2) Prompt Engineering Research : Delve \ndeeper into prompt engineering to optimize LLM interactions for domain -specific tasks, thereby ensuring  \nthat questions or tasks are interpreted with higher accuracy , self -consistency,  and context -awareness, and \n3) Semantic Search Enhancements : As we acknowledge the potential of semantic search in quickly \nlocating relevant insights, future research can focus on improving its efficiency and precision, especially in \ndomain -specific contexts.  \n5.2 Multi -Modal LLMs  \nMulti -modal LLMs represent a frontier in AI technology, where the systems are designed to process and \nintegrate information from various types of data — including, but not limited to, text, images, and videos \n— to perform more complex and nuanced tasks.

What is the role of truth conditional semantics in defining the meanings of strings or well-formed sentences?,"['2 Context\nOur results are particularly relevant to downstream\ntasks that require an agent to not only create ﬂuent,\ncreative and contextually relevant speech but also\nto act precisely based on the meaning of linguistic\nexpressions and reliably recognize semantic incon-\nsistency. For a robot that has been instructed (via\nconversation) to tighten every screw of a door, to\nnever walk on an airplane wing, or to stop drilling\nimmediately if certain conditions hold, acting ap-\npropriately requires being able to infer what do to\nbased on the linguistic meaning of the words ev-\nery,never ,stop,immediately andif—and in these\ncases, getting things mostly right won’t do, espe-\ncially if lives or substantial economic loss are at\nrisk.\nAn important corollary of our argument is that\nwhile it might be tempting to separate reason-\ning and linguistic competence ( Mahowald et al. ,\n2023 ), the former is in fact inextricably tied to\nour ability to draw inferences based on linguistic\ncontent—not just on, say, mathematical or real-\nworld facts. This in turn suggests that approaches\nwhich attempt to patch up knowledge deﬁciencies\nfor LLMs by giving them access to external mod-\nels (Mialon et al. ,2023 ) will fall short in devel-\noping reliable models of linguistic understanding\nbecause LLMs fail to grasp the notions that under-\nlie the very way that sentences (and actions) are\nwoven together in conversation.\nEmpirical studies like Chaturvedi et al. (2022 )\nshow that LLM failures to respect semantic en-\ntailment in question answering tasks follow from\nfundamental features of LLM training; thus while\nextensive training and large data sets may im-\nprove LLM results, performance will inevitably re-\nmain unstable and we should continue to expect\nhallucinations and reasoning errors in NLP tasks\nlike question-answering and natural language in-\nference.\n3 Language models and formal\nsemantics with continuations\n3.1 LLMs and strings\nWe consider LLMs trained on transformer archi-\ntectures over very large corpora using classic lan-\nguage modeling tasks, namely masked language\nmodeling or next sentence prediction. The for-\nmer involves masking certain words in a given\ncorpus and training the model to guess the miss-ing words, while in the latter, a context (a sen-\ntence typically) is provided to the model, which\nis trained to predict the sentence that follows. This\nunsupervised training allows language models to\nbuild rich internal representations that have been\nshown through probing to contain at least implic-\nitly a large amount of linguistic information ( De-\nvlin et al. ,2019 ;Liu et al. ,2019 ;Tenney et al. ,\n2018 ).\nFormally, LLMs learn a function f:C×X→\n[0,1]that assigns a probability to a word (or string\nor discourse move) x∈Xgiven a context (or ﬁ-\nnite string) C. More abstractly, let Vbe a count-\nable set called the vocabulary. For i >0, letVide-\nnote the set of all length istrings in the vocabulary\nVandV≤idenote the set of all strings Vwhose\nlength is at most i.V∗denotes the set of all ﬁnite\nstrings and Vωthe set of countably inﬁnite strings\ninV. We can then rewrite fasf:V≤n→µ,\nwhereµis a probability measure (which is often\ncalled its prediction ) overVn+mform≥1. Typ-\nically, the prediction function is used on strings of\nlengthmwheremis smaller than n.\nBy exploiting f, an LLM can extend µto a\ndistribution on the set of strings V∗. The most\nstraightforward way is to follow autoregressive\nmodels that calculate the probability of strings\nvia conditionalization. For a new sentence s′=\n(w1,w2,...,wm+1), and an input string sof length\nn provided as context, we have:\nµn+m+1(s′|s) =µn+1(w1|s)×µn+2(w2|s,w1)×\n(1)\n...×µn+m(wn|s,wm−1,...,w1)\nFor anys′∈V∗, µ(s′)represents the conﬁdence\nwith which an LLM predicts s′, after training on\nstrings in V≤n.\n3.2 Linguistic meaning\nIn what follows, we are in interested strings that\nhave a well formed meaning and are evaluable as\ntrue or false. Linguists use truth conditional se-\nmantics to deﬁne the meanings of strings or well\nformed sentences in terms of the conditions un-\nder which they are true. Thanks to the work of\nTarski (1944 ,1956 ), we can formalize the notion\nof truth conditions using the set-theoretic notion\nof a model that deﬁnes denotations or truth con-\nditions for sentences recursively from denotations\nfor sentential constituents ( Dowty et al. ,1981 ).\nThe notion of a model not only serves to deﬁne\ntruth conditions; it also captures entailments.

What ethical and moral considerations were taken into account when evaluating the development and sharing of an attack taxonomy for LLM-based plugin systems?,"['our consequentialist analysis. LLM and LLM-based systems\nare innovating incredibly rapidly, and researchers (including\nourselves) are uncovering vulnerabilities with deployed sys-\ntems.\nThe first question we asked ourselves: is it ethical and\nmoral to develop and share an attack taxonomy for LLM-\nbased plugin systems? (Just developing but not sharing\nwould have little consequentialist output). We determined\nthat the benefits of creating and sharing such a taxon-\nomy outweigh the harms. The taxonomy can enable those\ndeveloping LLM-based systems and the security research\ncommunity to have dedicated, detailed discussions about\nhow to mitigate future vulnerabilities, as well as discussions\nabout which vulnerabilities may be high risk and which may\nnot. Further, as is often the case in other technology sub-\nareas, those seeking to cause harm to platforms and users\n(the adversaries) may be developing attack capabilities in\nsilent. If those adversaries manifest before platforms and\nthe security community are able to proactively discuss and\ndevelop defenses, there could be significant harms.\nThe next question we asked ourselves was: is it ethi-\ncal and moral to evaluate a real system (ChatGPT) with\nrespect to our attack taxonomy? Here, we observe several\nkey benefits. First, our attack taxonomy benefited greatly\nfrom the proactive experimentation with ChatGPT and the\nresulting lessons from such experimentation and, hence, the\nexperimentation with ChatGPT contributed to the benefits\ndescribed in the above paragraph. Second, we again observe\nthat adversaries may be operating silently and, hence, it\nis beneficial to understand actual risks before adversaries\nmanifest. Third, we stress that we did notmount any attacks\nagainst any parties. Rather, we studied what different plugins\ncould doifthey were adversarial.\nAs part of our research process, we also asked our-\nselves: is it ethical and moral to experimentally develop\n“malicious” (or at least plugins with the potential to be\nmalicious though perhaps reserved in some way, e.g., collect\nprivate information but not use it) and publish them on\nthe OpenAI’s plugin store? A benefit of doing so would\nbe a concrete experimental evaluation of OpenAI’s review\nprocess. However, the harms in this scenario — the potential\nto accidentally harm users even if we took precautions —\noutweigh the benefits, especially since information about the\nOpenAI’s plugin review process (a single reviewer assigned\nto review all published plugins [75]) is already known.\nHence, we did not seek to publish any plugins on the\nOpenAI’s plugin store.\nThe next question we asked ourselves was: what should\nbe the disclosure process? A consequentialist analysis of\nthe disclosure processes is complicated by the significant\nuncertainties about the future of LLMs, LLM-based systems,\nand adversarial capabilities. It is known that consequentialist\nanalyses under uncertainties can be fundamentally challeng-\ning [38]. Our deontological analysis, however, did lead to\na clear and conservative conclusion. Hence, we center our\ndeontological analysis in this discussion. Specifically, we\nobserve that the people running OpenAI have rights. In this\ncase, we believe that they have the right to learn our findingsand have a chance to respond prior to our paper being public.\nHence, we have determined that the morally correct process\nis to share our findings with OpenAI before publishing this\npaper, which we have already done.\nAnother question we asked ourselves: what should be\nthe process of disclosing our findings to any plugins that\nwe mention in this paper? As noted elsewhere, it bears\nre-stressing that we did notseek to find vulnerabilities in\nplugins and we did notattack any plugins. Rather, we used\nproperties of existing plugins to gather evidence about the\npotential capabilities of adversarial plugins. Still, from a\ndeontological perspective, we determined that plugin authors\nhave the right to know about our analyses, and hence we\nhave informed plugin authors about our results and findings\nwith respect to their plugins.\nAppendix C.\nData exfiltration\nWe encountered several plugins which collect excessive\namount of user data, including personal and sensitive data.\nC.1. Personal and personally identifiable informa-\ntion collection\nOne such plugin is Clinical Trial Radar [76], which\nassists users in finding and understanding clinical trials for\nvarious diseases. To recommend relevant trials, the plugins\ncollects sensitive and personal user information, including\nthe diseases they are suffering, disease stage, prior treat-\nments, location, and other health details. The plugins in-\nstructs the LLM, through its description, to limit user data\ncollection and anonymize user input. However, even with\nthese filters, ChatGPT does not warn users to not share\nexcessive data. We also did not notice any attempt from\nChatGPT to anonymize user input. Clinical Trial Radar\ninteraction link1presents our interaction with the plugin.\nThis analysis was conducted on June 07, 2023.\nC.1.1. Sharing of already collected information. Another\nsimilar plugin called Magic [77] had even more specific\ninstructions for ChatGPT to “Keep in mind that you do not\nneed to ask for personal information such as users’ name\nor email address” . However, based on our interactions we\nnoticed that these instructions did not apply to the data\nthat was shared before prompting the plugin. Specifically,\nwe provided personal details (such as name, email address,\ndate of birth, health issues) to ChatGPT and asked it to\narrange the travel. When ChatGPT contacted Magic, these\ndetails were automatically shared in the API request. Magic\nbefore prompting link2provides interaction with the plu-\ngin when data was shared before prompting.

What is the role of modality-augmented training in the development of the Audio-Visual LLM for video understanding?,"['Audio-Visual LLM for Video Understanding\nFangxun Shu1* Lei Zhang1,2∗Hao Jiang1†Cihang Xie3†\n1Alibaba Group2Zhejiang University3University of California, Santa Cruz\nAbstract\nThis paper presents Audio-Visual LLM, a Multimodal\nLarge Language Model that takes both visual and audi-\ntory inputs for holistic video understanding. A key de-\nsign is the modality-augmented training, which involves the\nintegration of modality-specific tokens engineered to acti-\nvate the appropriate visual and/or auditory encoder selec-\ntively. This mechanism is pivotal in enabling end-to-end\njoint training with video data at different modalities, in-\ncluding visual-only, audio-only, and audio-visual formats.\nMoreover, we introduce a high-quality video instruction\ndataset, derived from GPT-4. This dataset allows Audio-\nVisual LLM to adeptly process a variety of task-oriented\nvideo instructions, ranging from multi-turn conversations\nand audio-visual narratives to complex reasoning tasks.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Audio-Visual\nLLM impressively achieves strong zero-shot results across\na range of video understanding tasks. For example, Audio-\nVisual LLM achieves an accuracy of 53.7% on MSRVTT-\nQA, outperforming non-LLM-based InterVideo by 6.6% and\nLLM-based Valley by 4.4%, respectively. Additionally, our\nAudio-Visual LLM also achieves competitive performance\non audio tasks ( e.g., AudioCaps).\n1. Introduction\nVideos are inherently multimodal, encapsulating both audi-\ntory and visual information. This multimodality is not just\nan inherent characteristic of videos but also a fundamental\naspect of how humans perceive and interact with visual me-\ndia. For instance, in a cinematic context, the simultaneous\nengagement with both visual imagery and auditory cues sig-\nnificantly enriches the viewing experience, enhancing both\ncomprehension and enjoyment. Drawing inspiration from\nthis intrinsic human experience, empowering multimodal\nmodels [37, 40, 45, 52, 68] to concurrently understand vi-\nsual and audio leads to substantial improvements in video\nunderstanding.\n*Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding author.\nMSRVTT-QAMSVD-QA\nActivityNet-QA\nAVSDAVSSDMUSIC-QAClothoV1AudioCaps243852\n485766104628502035454035344439282522342627\nVideo-LLaMAOursValleyFigure 1. Audio-Visual LLM achieves advantageous performance\non various video understanding tasks and consistently outperforms\nexisting methods.\nLarge language models [4, 9, 20, 72] have shown sig-\nnificant abilities in intent understanding and instruction fol-\nlowing. They can interact with human intents and provide\nappropriate feedback based on the given instructions. Re-\nsearch works [3, 29, 43] further extend to LLMs with vi-\nsual perception abilities, designing alignment modules and\ncurating instruction-following datasets, particularly in im-\nage understanding [6, 39, 48, 87] and video understand-\ning [44, 53, 55]. However, these early efforts mostly focus\non visual content, thereby underutilizing the rich auditory\ndata present in videos.\nTo bridge this gap, recent works [54, 69, 86] have be-\ngun to incorporate visual and audio components in enhanc-\ning video understanding. However, these models still ex-\nhibit significant limitations in the joint processing of audio-\nvisual data. Video-LLaMA’s [86] approach to audio sig-\nnal representation and alignment is potentially limited, as it\nprimarily relies on the capability of the pre-trained Image-\nBind model [26]. Similarly, MacawLLM [54] adopts visual\nand audio signals extracted from videos of different sources,\nwhich may induce bias and instability in training. These ob-\nservations highlight a substantial opportunity for improve-\nment in aligning audio-visual modalities, both in terms of\nmodel architecture and dataset development.\n1arXiv:2312.06720v2  [cs.CV]  13 Dec 2023']","The role of modality-augmented training in the development of the Audio-Visual LLM for video understanding is to integrate modality-specific tokens engineered to activate the appropriate visual and/or auditory encoder selectively.

How does identifying community structure help in understanding the overall dynamics of a network?,"['Marios Papachristou and Yuan Yuan 6\nThese results suggest that LLM agents exhibit the tendency of triadic closure. Similar to the\napproach in earlier reasoning analysis, we present the most common reasons provided by LLMs in\nAppendix C7. We find that most of the agents base their decisions on the number of mutual friends.\nPrinciple 3: Homophily. Homophily reflects the tendency for nodes with similar characteristics or\nattributes to form connections and associate with each other. This phenomenon is based on the\nprinciple that individuals in a network are more likely to connect with others who share similar\ntraits, interests, or demographics [34].\nTo test whether LLM agents exhibit homophily, we perform the following experiment: We\ngenerate nodes with randomly generated attributes regarding a hobby (randomly chosen among\nthree hobbies), a favorite color (randomly chosen among three colors), and a location within the\nUS (randomly chosen among three US locations) and provide the attributes of the other nodes and\nthe node’s own attributes, and each node is tasked to form up to 𝛿=5links with others. For each\nnode𝑖, we provide it with the features 𝑥𝑗of all non-neighbors 𝑗of𝑖. The seed network is taken to\nbe the empty graph.\nWe run ten simulations for networks with 𝑛=50nodes and𝛿=5. We compare with the Random\nnull model, which chooses 𝛿=5links at random.\nTo measure the presence of homophily, we measure the attribute assortativity coefficient of\neach of the three features (hobby, color, location). For a property 𝑃which takes 𝐾distinct values\n𝑃1,...,𝑃𝐾, itsassortativity coefficient 𝑅is defined as\n𝑅=Í𝑛\n𝑖=1𝑀𝑖𝑖−Í𝑛\n𝑖=1𝑎𝑖𝑏𝑖\n1−Í𝑛\n𝑖=1𝑎𝑖𝑏𝑖,\nwhere𝑀is the mixing matrix with entries 𝑀𝑖𝑗corresponding to the fraction of edges where one\nend has value 𝑃𝑖, and the other end has value 𝑃𝑗,𝑎𝑖=Í𝑛\n𝑗=1𝑀𝑖𝑗and𝑏𝑖=Í𝑛\n𝑗=1𝑀𝑗𝑖. The assortativity\nhas values between −1and+1, where a positive value denotes the tendency of the nodes to connect\nto other similar nodes (hence yielding a homophilous network), and a negative value corresponds\nto connecting to the tendency to connect to dissimilar nodes (which indicates heterophily).\nIn Figure 3, we observe a consistent pattern of positive assortativity across all temperature ranges,\nwhich is higher for lower temperatures. Moreover, the observed assortativity at all temperatures\nsignificantly deviates from Random , which has assortativity close to 0 ( 𝑃<0.001, t-test comparing\nwith Random ). Taken together, we conclude homophily emerges for the networks generated by\nLLMs.\nMoreover, we present the probability of each reason being mentioned in Appendix C. We find\nthat shared hobbies appear to be much more important than shared location or favorite color. This\nis consistent with our intuition that, similarly to humans, LLMs care more about hobbies than other\nsuperficial attributes when forming social connections.\n2.2 Macro-Level Principles\nPrinciple 4: Community Structure. The community structure of networks refers to the organization\nof nodes or individuals within a network into distinct and densely interconnected groups or\nclusters [ 8,15,37,38]. Identifying community structures is crucial for understanding the overall\ndynamics of a network, as it reveals patterns of relationships and interactions that might not be\napparent at the global level.\n7We do not provide the distribution of reasons for the results of Figure 2(b) as all of the LLM’s decisions are made given the\nnumber of common neighbors information.']","Identifying community structures is crucial for understanding the overall dynamics of a network, as it reveals patterns of relationships and interactions that might not be apparent at the global level.",simple,"[{'page_label': '6', 'file_name': '2402.10659v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.10659v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 18000869, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How has the use of LLMs in consumer complaints changed since the release of ChatGPT?,"['Figure 2: Constructed from 824,525 complaints, the graph shows the sudden surge in Likely-\nAI complaints beginning in 2023, reflecting the (growing popularity and) likely use of LLMs\nin consumer complaint writing.\nLikely-AI complaints, from near 0% up to 5%.

What is the purpose of using the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset in the experiments?,"['guage model developed by Open AI, with excellent\ncognitive understanding and response expression\ncapabilities.\n3.7 Implementation Details\nWe conduct experiments on the Empathetic-\nDialogue dataset (Rashkin et al., 2019), which is\na dialogue dataset with 32 fine-grained emotion\ncategories. For the small-scale empathetic model\nESCM tt, we retain all parameters of the original\nmodel. Meanwhile, we set the number of emo-\ntion cause words k1to 1. The number of most\nimportant emotion categories k2is set to differ-\nent optimal values for different LLMs due to their\ndiverse characteristics. As for LLMs, we choose\nLlama2 7b, Llama2 13b, ChatGLM3 6b, Mistral 7b, and\nChatGPT as the large language models for HEF.\nWe experiment with the ChatGPT model through\nthe API interface, while other models primarily ex-\nperiment using the LLaMA-Factory framework2\non the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. Furthermore, to\nvalidate the model’s performance, we use GPT4.0\nfor human-like evaluation.\n3.8 Evaluation Metrics\nTo validate the effectiveness of the Hybrid Empathy\nFramework (HEF), we employ the following two\nevaluation methods:\nAutomatic Evaluation . Following previous\nmethods (Li et al., 2022; Sabour et al., 2022),\nwe employ perplexity, accuracy, Distinct-1, and\nDistinct-2 (Li et al., 2015). Perplexity reflects the\nfluency of the responses, with lower scores indi-\ncating better performance. However, perplexity\ndoes not apply to large language models due to\nthe differences in their vocabularies (Qian et al.,\n2023). Accuracy measures the model’s emotion\nperception capability. The stronger the emotion\nperception ability, the higher the score. Distinct-1\nand Distinct-2 evaluate the diversity of responses\nat the unigram and bigram levels, respectively. For\nsmall-scale models, the higher the diversity score,\nthe richer the information reflected. Whereas for\nlarge language models, we find that to a certain\nextent, the lower the diversity, the higher the qual-\nity of the responses. It is worth noting that, as\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) does not apply to\nthe empathetic response generation task (Liu et al.,\n2016; Sabour et al., 2022), we do not consider this\nmetric.\n2https://github.com/hiyouga/\nLLaMA-FactoryHuman-like Evaluation Metrics . Since the\nevaluation based on GPT4 is highly consistent with\nhuman evaluation (Qian et al., 2023), we employ\nGPT4 to replace the time-consuming manual evalu-\nation. Following previous methods (Li et al., 2022;\nYang et al., 2023b), we use an A/B test to com-\npare the baselines and HEF-Based models. We first\nrandomly select 100 dialogue samples and pair-\nwise compare the effects of the baseline and HEF-\nbased models. For the same dialogue, if the HEF-\nbased model performs better, we increment the\nscore for Win. If the HEF-based model performs\nworse, we increment the score for Lose . To com-\nprehensively evaluate the model’s performance, we\nassess it from the perspectives of Empathy (Emp.),\nRelevance (Rel.), and Fluency (Flu.). Empathy\nmeasures whether the emotional response is appro-\npriate. Relevance measures whether the response\nis relevant to the content and topic of the dialogue\ncontext. Fluency measures whether the response is\nnatural, fluent, and aligns with human expression\nhabits.\n4 Results and Analysis\n4.1 Main Results\nAutomatic Evaluation Results . The results of\nthe automatic evaluation metrics are shown in Ta-\nble 2. The results indicate that SEMs and LLMs\nhave complementary strengths in understanding\nand expression. That is, SEMs demonstrate bet-\nter fine-grained emotion comprehension abilities,\nwhile LLMs exhibit better expression capabilities.\nAdditionally, the HEF-based model outperforms\nboth SEMs and LLMs in terms of comprehension\nand expression capabilities.\nIn terms of emotion accuracy, the HEF-based\nmodel outperforms SEMs and LLMs. This is pri-\nmarily because HEF-based models have higher ac-\ncuracy in predicting coarse-grained emotion cate-\ngories (e.g. 6 classes), while the two-stage emo-\ntion strategy converts the 32 emotion classification\ninto a coarse-grained emotion classification task,\nsuch as 3 categories. This enhances the emotion\nclassification accuracy of the HEF-based model.\nAdditionally, we find Llama2 7band Llama2 13bper-\nform significantly worse than ChatGLM3 6band\nMistra 7b. This is because Llama2 7band Llama2 13b\nhave relatively poor instruction-following abilities\nwithout fine-tuning, resulting in predicted emotions\nnot belonging to the 32 emotion categories.\nIn terms of diversity, the HEF-based model out-']",The purpose of using the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset in the experiments is to conduct experiments on a dialogue dataset with 32 fine-grained emotion categories.,simple,"[{'page_label': '6', 'file_name': '2402.11801v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.11801v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 341077, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

In contrast, Self-\nConsistency can not handle non-numerical tasks\ndirectly, e.g., translation, due to its voting mech-\nanism (Table 5).

Compared to the multi-agent de-\nbate, Self-Contrast gains more significant improve-\nments with less call overhead (>10% reduction).\nFrom a unified perspective, it can be viewed as\na multi-agent contrastive mechanism. Instead of\na free-form debate among multiple agents, our\nstrategy fosters a more explicit and purposeful de-\nbate by contrasting the differences between agents\nand summarizing the reasons for their disagree-\nments. Moreover, Self-Contrast is flexible, dynam-\nically designing multiple perspectives tailored to\nuser requests, without the need for manually pre-\nconfiguring agent roles and quantities.\n5The Effect of the Different Components\nThe above results show that Self-Contrast inspires\nreflection more accurately and stably than direct\nevaluation. It encompasses a self-curated promptprocess, which fosters diverse solving perspectives\nto mitigate self-evaluation biases. Besides, it in-\nvolves a checklist generation process to facilitate\nre-examination. We analyze their effect as follows:\nSelf-curated Prompt Vs. Sampling Multiple\nResponses. Instead of self-curated prompt process,\nwe directly sample multiple responses from LLMs\nfor subsequent contrast and reflection. Figure A2\nshows that the final accuracy improves as the num-\nber of sampled responses increases, yet it is still\nlower than Self-Contrast with self-curated prompts\nprocess, where full strategy achieves 84.4% com-\npared to the maximum of 81.8% when sampling\n5 responses. We find that the top-n responses are\nsometimes strikingly similar, diminishing the effec-\ntiveness of the contrastive strategy.\nReflection Without Checklist. We eliminate\nthe checklist generation process, i.e., directly in-\nstruct the LLM to reflect on the differences among\nperspectives. In Table A1, it brings a significant\nimpact on mathematical reasoning (-3.5%), but a\nslight impact on translation (-0.1%), since trans-\nlation tasks tend to focus more on local features.\nEven without a checklist, the LLM also can reflect\nbased on the comparisons of lexical, syntactic.\n6 Analysis\n6.1 Reducing Invalid and Toxic Reflections\nAs mentioned in Table 2, due to overly confident or\nhighly random in the self-evaluate process, vanilla\nself-reflection contains a large amount of invalid\n(✗→✗: 20.3%) or toxic reflections ( ✓→✗: 4%).\nTherefore we investigate how Self-Contrast im-\nproves these two scenarios on GSM8K. As shown\nin Table 6, we observe that with Self-Contrast, the', 'Strategy GSM8K SV AMP CommonMT\nSelf-Evaluate w/ top-1 -0.8 0.7 0.2\nt(∆>0)↑ -0.43 0.18 0.15\nSelf-Evaluate w/ top-2 0.12 0.8 0.16\nt(∆>0)↑ 0.21 0.41 0.33\nSelf-Contrast w/ top-2 0.9 2.5 0.45\nt(∆>0)↑ 1.43 2.72 1.89\nTable 3: We report the accuracy change ( ∆) between\npost- and pre-reflection for 3 settings and t-test value\nfor∆>0.

As shown\nin Figure 1 (bottom), we sample Top-2 responses\nfrom LLM and then prompt LLM to contrast their\ndifferences in detail, rethink the reasons that caused\nthe discrepancies, and summarize the checklist for\nre-examining and resolving the discrepancy. As\nshown in Table 3, we compare three scenarios:\nself-evaluate w/ top-1 response, self-evaluate w/\ntop-2 responses, and self-contrast w/ top-2. Our\nnew strategy achieves a modest improvement over\nstandard reflection using self-evaluate. Notably, it\nsignificantly enhances the significance levels (t-test:\n-0.43 to 1.43), suggesting it can greatly mitigate the\nuncertainty associated with self-evaluate process.\n3 Self-Contrast\nPrior sections illustrate the challenges LLMs en-\ncounter in accurately evaluating previous solutions,\noften resulting in overconfident or inconsistent\nfeedback. Concurrently, we observe that leverag-\ning the discrepancies between two different solu-\ntions can catalyze a more efficacious reflection,\nnotably reducing the uncertainty during the reflec-\ntion. Building upon this insight, we propose a more\ndiverse inter-perspective Self-Contrast, facilitating\nmore reliable self-reflection.\nSelf-Contrast consists of three procedures: Cre-\nate Diverse Perspectives, Contrast Inter-Perspective\nDiscrepancies, and Eliminate Discrepancies. In\nCreate Diverse Perspectives ( §3.1), we encour-\nage LLMs to autonomously create a variety of\nprompts tailored to the user’s request, each of-\nfering a unique perspective for problem-solving,\ne.g., different thinking styles, diverse identities,\npersonalities, or preferences. These diverse per-\nspectives prompt the LLM to generate different re-\nsponses. In the second stage ( §3.2), LLM contrasts\nthe differences between each pair of responses.\nLastly ( §3.3), to eliminate discrepancies, we ab-stract these differences into a detailed checklist for\nre-examining. This checklist guides the LLM to\nmeticulously examine the causes of discrepancies,\nincluding random errors or intrinsic biases, which\nresult in inconsistent results among perspectives.\nAs shown in Figure 2, LLM designs five different\nprompts and their translation results based on the\nuser’s request ("" 这个计划被枪毙"") . From a literal\nperspective, the phrase "" 被枪毙"" is translated as\n""shot to death"". This rigid translation fails to grasp\nthe metaphor embedded in the military term. Con-\nversely, from a liberal perspective, it is translated\nas ""This plan was axed"". After contrasting two\ndifferent translations, LLMs believe they should\nscrutinize the source sentence for metaphors and\nensure the translation aligns with the conventions\nof English expression.\n3.1 Create Diverse Perspectives\nSelf-Curated Prompts First, it is imperative to de-\nfine the concept of ""solving perspective"". It refers\nto deliberate prompting with a unique role, person-\nality, thought style, etc., which prompts LLMs to\nsolve user requests from a specific perspective. Di-\nverse solving perspectives can endow LLMs with\na broader range of thoughts for problem-solving,\ne.g., different angles and methodologies, thereby\nmitigating biases introduced by singular prompts.\nTo achieve this, we adopt a self-curated prompt\nstrategy, where the LLM itself adaptively generates\nmultiple different prompts for each request, each\nsignifying a tailored perspective, then samples cor-\nresponding responses based on these prompts. It\nis noteworthy that the number of perspectives to\nbe created, and the design of each perspective are\nentirely determined by LLMs, endowing them with\nmore flexibility to address complex tasks. The de-\ntails of the prompt are provided in Appendix D.1.\nIn Figure 3, we present statistics on the number of\nprompts generated in self-curated prompt process.\n3.2 Contrast Inter-Perspective Discrepancies\nThe LLM generates diverse responses based on self-\ncurated prompts, each representing a specific per-\nspective. Considering that some responses may be\nhighly similar or even identical, we first filter these\nsimilar responses. Then, we select the responses\nwith significant discrepancies for comparison.\nSelecting To filter out similar responses, we em-\nploy the K-Medoids clustering algorithm based\non their semantic similarity. We categorize all re-\nsponses into kclusters, each encompassing a set']","The self-curated prompt process in the Self-Contrast strategy involves the LLM adaptively generating multiple different prompts for each request, each signifying a tailored perspective.

It in-\njects diverse synthetic captions and removes noisy captions\nto achieve unified vision-language understanding and gen-\neration. Meanwhile, VisionLLM [44] aligns vision-centric\ntasks with language tasks, allowing for flexible definition\nand management through language instructions. Further-\nmore, the introduction of 3D Multi-modal Large Language\nModels (3D MLLMs) [22, 24, 45, 46] aims to broaden the\nscope of knowledge, reasoning, and conversational capa-\nbilities obtained from LLMs to encompass the 3D modal-\nity. For instance, several projects leverage GPT-3 [19] or\nLLaMA [42] to improve the language-based comprehen-\nsion of 3D spatial geometry, as demonstrated in works like\nPointCLIP V2 [54] and ViewRefer [21]. They focus on the\n3D point cloud with a single object or an indoor scene.\nIn contrast to these approaches, we are the first to ex-\nploit the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for understanding\noutdoor 3D scenes and completing tasks such as caption-\ning, 3D grounding, and 3D question answering. The unique\nchallenges posed by 3D LiDAR point cloud data, includ-\ning the lack of LiDAR-text paired data and encompassing\na variety of objects and relationships, present difficulties in\nmultimodal alignment and reasoning.\n2.2. 3D-Language Tasks\nThe combination of 3D point clouds and natural language\nholds diverse applications and has recently attracted grow-ing attention [1, 10, 11, 18, 23, 26]. Specifically, 3D cap-\ntioning [11, 13] is required to describe a particular object\nwithin a 3D scene. 3D visual grounding [10, 48] focuses on\ngenerating the location of the object that the text expression\nrefers to. Meanwhile, in the context of 3D visual question\nanswering [5], the model needs to answer language ques-\ntions given the visual content of the 3D scene.\nHowever, 3D approaches for the aforementioned tasks\nare designed to address individual task-specific challenges\nwithout exploring their commonalities and providing a uni-\nfied solution. Moreover, these methods are tailored for in-\ndoor point cloud tasks and may not directly transfer to out-\ndoor LiDAR since LiDAR is much sparser and more diverse\nin geometric relationships. To reconcile this, we propose\nLiDAR-LLM, a LiDAR-oriented approach, to uniformly\nperform 3D tasks of outdoor scenes.\n3. Method\n3.1. Overview\nThe overall framework of LiDAR-LLM is presented in\nFig. 2.

Since\nthe internal reasoning of the LLM can be partially\nobserved through the output explanation, back-\ntranslating such explanations into the source lan-\nguage allows us to compare the internal reasoning\nused to solve the problem in each language. High\nsimilarity of explanations should indicate homo-\ngeneity in using the same internal reasoning pro-\ncess to perform the task in both languages. On the\nother hand, dissimilarity in the reasoning process\nacross languages should be reflected in a lower\nexplanation similarity.\n4.3 Identifying Multilingual Types\nIn our investigation, we employ both Prompt Trans-\nlation (PT) and Response Back-Translation (RBT)\nto analyze how an LLM solves TE and TV tasks\nin different languages. As depicted in the first two\nsteps in Figure 5, a compound LLM should exhibit\nconsistent results on TE tasks with both methods.\nThis is because a compound model performance\ndoes not depend on the language in which a ques-\ntion is presented. Conversely, subordinate and coor-\ndinate types of networks are expected to yield some-\nwhat different results on TE tasks.

In contrast, a pure subordinate model is\nexpected to reason only in the dominant language,\nproducing relatively similar results in different lan-\nguages, regardless of whether the correct output is\npreserved after translation.\n5 Experiments\nWe apply the methodology proposed in Section 4\nto TE and TV tasks. As our LLM, we use Chat-\nGPT, via the official web application2, due to its\navailability.\n5.1 Datasets\nReasoning We use 50 instances selected at ran-\ndom from each of two datasets: GSM8K (Cobbe\n2https://chat.openai.com/"", 'tasks in the Reasoning and Knowledge Access cate-\ngories are regarded as Translation Equivariant since\nthe correct output does not depend on the chosen\nlanguage.

For such tasks, translating the\ninput may change the correct output. TV tasks rely\nheavily on the language used, and include many\ntasks in the Articulation category. Representative\nTV tasks that we investigate in our experiments are\nletter writing andpun understanding . The former\nis subject to the conventions of the specific lan-\nguage and culture, while the latter involves word\npolysemy, which is often sensitive to translation.\nFigure 3 shows an example where a pun is present\nin the original English input, but not in the Span-\nish translation, making the classification dependent\nupon the order in which translation is applied.\n4 Methods\nIn this section, we present our approach to analyz-\ning the multilingual ability of LLMs. Our methods\ninvolve prompt translation (PT) and response back-\ntranslation (RBT). They are designed to measure\nperformance of an LLM, and its consistency across\nlanguages. In our experiments, we apply these\nmethods to both TE and TV tasks, with the aim of\ndetermining the type of bilingualism (compound,\ncoordinate, or subordinate) exhibited by an LLM.\n4.1 Prompt Translation\nMultilingual datasets are unvailable for many tasks.\nHowever, with state-of-the-art machine translation\n(MT) systems and LLMs, we can translate monolin-\ngual datasets for TE tasks to generate parallel mul-\ntilingual parallel data with minimal loss of infor-\nmation (Whitehouse et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023).\nThis is the key intuition behind prompt transla-\ntion (PT); an example is shown in Figure 4a, where\nan English multiple choice question, and its possi-\nble answers, are translated to Chinese. The LLM is\nthen prompted, and the response is given and eval-\nuated, in Chinese. Prompting in distinct languages\nis performed in independent LLM sessions.\nWe measure the differences in multilingual task\nperformance by comparing the answers given by\nthe LLM in each language.

This\nis because TE tasks, such as mathematical problem\nsolving, do not depend on the language used to\nquery the LLMs, as the solution does not depend\non the language used to express the problem.\n4.2 Response Back-Translation\nOne of the goals of our work is to understand what\nthe consistency of LLM output across languages\ntells us about the model, and to determine the type\nof bilingualism an LLM exhibits. This is crucial for\nindividuals who use LLMs for multilingual tasks,\nas it can impact the way task results are gener-\nated, and affect the quality and consistency of the\nresults. For example, a network exhibiting sub-\nordinate bilingualism would produce output that\nappears to be the result of translation, rather than\nresembling text generated by a native speaker of\nthe output language.\nTo quantitatively measure how reasoning is per-\nformed, we propose a prompting method based on\nback-translation, as illustrated in Figure 4b. Simi-\nlar to prompt translation (Section 4.1), we begin by\ntranslating the instance to the target language, and\nprompting the LLM to produce a response in that\nlanguage. After obtaining output from the LLM,\nregardless of the language, we further prompt the\nLLM to generate an explanation for its output (e.g.,\n“Explain how you obtain this result” ); and then trans-\nlate the output of the LLM back to the original\nlanguage. We then compare the explanation given']","Prompt translation (PT) and response back-translation (RBT) methods can be used to analyze the multilingual ability of LLMs by measuring performance and consistency across languages. PT involves translating monolingual datasets for TE tasks to generate parallel multilingual data, prompting the LLM in different languages, and comparing the answers. RBT involves translating the instance to the target language, prompting the LLM to produce a response, obtaining an explanation for the output, and translating the explanation back to the original language to compare reasoning processes.",simple,"[{'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1291780, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1291780, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

What is a goal-directed deterministic planning problem in the context of classical planning?,"['3 Prompt Generation for Classical Planning Problems\n3.1 Background\nGiven that we are interested in investigating the basic reasoning about actions and change problem, we\nwant to look at the most fundamental planning formalism first, namely the goal-directed deterministic\nplanning problem. Colloquially referred to as classical planning problem , these problem classes\nconsist of a problem domain, an initial state and a goal state. The problem domain consists of a set\nof fluents which correspond to predicates with some arity and a set of actions. The state-space for\nthe planning problem is defined by the possible truth assignment over the predicates. Each action\nconsists of preconditions and effects where preconditions is a set of predicates that describe when an\naction can be executed and effects are set of predicates that describe what happens when an action is\nexecuted. The effects can further consist of add effects, which is the set of predicates that will be set\ntrue by the action, and delete effects, which is the set of predicates that will be set false. The solution\nfor a planning problem is a sequence of actions, or a plan, that when applied in the initial state will\nresult in a state where the goal conditions are satisfied. A standard representation to specify such\nkind of planning problems is the Planning Definition and Domain Language (PDDL) [ 22]. Below is\na snippet of an action from a popular benchmark problem called Blocksworld, in PDDL.

"What milestone has the introduction of the GPT series by OpenAI marked, particularly in the context of text generation tasks?","['IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS, VOL. 1, NO. 1, SEPTEMBER 2023 3\ntasks. Employing bidirectional encoders, BERT captures both\npreceding and succeeding contextual information for each\nword. While effective, BERT’s complexity results in high\ncomputational requirements.\nOpenAI’s introduction of the GPT series [58] [59] [7] has\nbeen another milestone, particularly for text generation tasks.\nThese models also exhibit ”zero-shot learning” capabilities,\nenabling them to perform certain tasks without task-specific\ntraining. However, for tasks requiring higher accuracy, fine-\ntuning is generally necessary.\nGPT models have been deployed in a wide array of ap-\nplications in NLP and artificial intelligence, such as chatbots,\nautomated writing, and question-answering systems, and have\nopened new avenues in multi-modal learning and code gener-\nation.\nIn summary, large language models are increasingly shaping\nvarious domains, and their ongoing development continues\nto reveal new potential. The widespread deployment and\ndiverse applications of these models not only underscore their\nimmediate utility but also open exciting possibilities for future\nresearch\nB. Embodied Intelligence\nEmbodied Intelligence is an emerging field focused on\nunderstanding and developing intelligent agents that interact\nclosely with their environment. The field posits that intelli-\ngence is fundamentally an emergent property of an agent’s\ninteraction with its surroundings, rather than a characteristic\ninherent in isolated, abstract computations. Drawing from\ndiverse disciplines such as neuroscience, psychology, robotics,\nand artificial intelligence, Embodied Intelligence aims to create\nnovel models and algorithms to simulate intelligent behavior.\nRecent progress in embodied artificial intelligence has lever-\naged advancements in natural language processing to convert\nhuman instructions into formats interpretable by physically\nembodied agents. Additionally, sophisticated techniques in\nobject recognition and scene understanding have been em-\nployed to enhance agents’ situational awareness. Research in\nthis area also utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms in planning\nand decision-making to allow agents to navigate complex\nenvironments effectively.\nGrowing interest exists in merging LLMs like GPT-3 with\nEmbodied Intelligence. Although powerful in natural language\nprocessing, LLMs typically lack direct engagement with the\nphysical world, as their training data consist primarily of\ntext. Integrating LLMs with embodied agents aims to cre-\nate language models with enhanced context-awareness and\nadaptability, potentially transforming the landscape of natural\nlanguage processing and intelligent agent behavior.\nIn the realm of Embodied Intelligence, the concept of an\nintelligent agent stands as a pivotal element. The control\nover these agents bifurcates into High-level and Low-level\nfacets. High-level controls encompass task scheduling and\nstrategy development, incorporating the likes of reinforcement\nlearning, deep learning, and the emergent methodologies based\non expansive language models. In contrast, Low-level control\npertains to the direct command over the agent’s operationalfunctions, such as control over position, speed, and force.\nAn agent’s capabilities hinge upon its design and its Low-\nlevel control parameters [4], while the execution and approach\nto the completion of tasks are orchestrated by High-level\ncontrols [46].\nThese methodologies have unfolded a spectrum of distinct\napplications, encompassing terrain recognition [72], prediction\nof machinery lifespan [76] and emulation of gaze mecha-\nnisms [44]. These strides not only reflect the dynamic essence\nof the field but also signify the tangible impact that these\ncontrolled embodied agents procure across a multitude of\ndomains.\nThe advancement of intelligent agents is contingent upon\nthe harmonious integration of high-level and low-level con-\ntrols. Utilizing superior algorithms and control techniques is\nessential for the development of new agents characterized by\ngreater robustness and broader generalization capabilities.\nFor example, the LM-Nav [66] model proposed by Shah\nand Dhruv combines a self-supervised robotic control model,\na vision-language model, and a large language model. Each\ncomponent brings specific strengths: visual perception and\nphysical interactivity from the robotic model, grounding of text\nto images from the vision-language model, and text parsing\nand translation from the large language model. LM-Nav thus\nenables long-horizon planning based on raw sensory inputs\nand free-form textual instructions, facilitating complex tasks\nin real-world settings.\nIn addition to research on single-agent systems, there is also\nresearch on multi-agent systems [65] [28] [62].Each of them\nindependently focus on the multi-agent cooperation issue.\nTheir respective research efforts are instrumental in broad-\nening the spectrum of tasks achievable by agents, boosting\nwork efficiency, and enhancing the real-world applicability and\ngeneralization of Embodied Agents.\nOne of the significant challenges in Embodied Intelligence\nlies in designing agents capable of real-time learning and\nadaptation to their environment. This calls for a deep un-\nderstanding of sensory-motor coordination and morphological\ncomputation, which are foundational elements of embodied\ncognition. Researchers employ various techniques such as\nmachine learning, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary al-\ngorithms to create agents that can learn from their experiences\nand improve performance over time.\nIII. LLM S IN EMBODIED AGENTS\nA. LLMs for Grounded Language Understanding\n”Grounded Language Understanding” aims to reconcile the\nabstract symbols processed by language models with concrete\nentities, actions, or states in the physical or simulated world.\nThis is pivotal for applications requiring real-world interac-\ntion, such as robotic control, natural language interfaces, or\nadvanced research in Embodied Intelligence.\nWithin this context, LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-4, and BERT\ncan integrate with sensors, databases, or simulated environ-\nments to generate and interpret language applicable to real-\nworld scenarios.

How are HR (Hit Rate) and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) used to assess the performance of recommendation models in the study?,"['Wang: Empowering Few-Shot Recommender Systems with Large Language Models-Enhanced Representations\nenhance certain recommender models that employ neural\nnetworks in a few-shot scenario.\nNotably, among all experimental models that integrated\nneural networks, the MLP model stands out as the only one\nto exhibit statistically significant results in both experimental\nand control datasets. In contrast, we observe that the CNN\nmodel exhibited a significantly high training loss and failed\nto successfully converge during training. We speculate that\nthis phenomenon can be attributed to the length of the con-\ncatenated embedding and the limited number of the training\nsamples, as certain neural networks may encounter detrimen-\ntal effects on learning and convergence with a few-shot sce-\nnario characterized by an abundance of training features.

A prompt\npis provided to obtain an output o=A(p).\nIn-Context Learning (ICL) builds upon IO by\nenriching the prompt with a sequence of demon-\nstrations, or example pairs, E={(xe, oe)}E\ne=1,\nthus guiding the LLM toward a desired output\no=A(E⊕p).\nChain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT) further en-\nhances ICL by appending a reasoning pathway\nreto each demonstration in E, resulting in E=\n{(xe, re, oe)}E\ne=1. This augmentation can improve\nthe LLM’s inference capabilities.\nNote that ⊕denotes concatenation, implying\nthat in both ICL and CoT, the example pairs Eare\nintegrated into the prompt pto form an extended\nprompt. Additionally, it’s noteworthy that ICL can\nbe regarded as a specialized form of IO, and CoT\nas a specialized form of ICL.\nInstruction Tuning (IT) is introduced to fine-tune\nLLMs based on task-specific instructions, enabling\nthem to generalize across various downstream tasks.\nThe process can be formulated as o=A(q⊕p),\nwhere qrepresents the task description.\nAlignment Tuning (AT) aims to fine-tune LLMs\nto align their behaviors with human preferences. In\naddition to human-labeled data, researchers utilize\nLLM-generated annotations for fine-tuning. Gen-\nerally, the LLM-based annotation process can be\nrepresented as z=A(q⊕x1⊕x2⊕p), where x1\nandx2denote two candidate responses generated\nby LLMs, and qrepresents the task description. z\nrepresents a score indicating human preference and\nis typically modeled as a value between 0 and 1.\nThis rating zjis generated according to a specific\nreward Rand indicates a human-based compari-\nson for the better candidate response xz, where\nR(q, xz)> R(q, x1−z)(Dubois et al., 2023).\n3 LLM-Based Data Annotation\nThe emergence of Large Language Models has\nsparked significant interest in their capacity for\nhigh-quality, context-sensitive data annotation.\nThis section explores the diverse techniques and\nmethodologies used for data annotation via LLMs.\n3.1 Manually Engineered Prompts\nManually engineered prompts are essential for\nLLMs in annotation tasks, designed to elicit spe-']","The context explores diverse techniques and methodologies for data annotation via LLMs, including manually engineered prompts.",simple,"[{'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2402.13446v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.13446v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1082739, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

What is the Translate-Infer-Compile (TIC) approach used for in the context of generating plans for natural language planning task requests?,"['TIC: Translate-Infer-Compile for accurate “text to plan” using\nLLMs and logical intermediate representations\nSudhir Agarwal andAnu Sreepathy\nIntuit AI Research\nMountain View, CA, USA.\n{sudhir agarwal, anu sreepathy }@intuit.com\nAbstract\nWe study the problem of generating plans for given\nnatural language planning task requests. On one\nhand, LLMs excel at natural language processing\nbut do not perform well on planning. On the\nother hand, classical planning tools excel at plan-\nning tasks but require input in a structured lan-\nguage such as the Planning Domain Definition Lan-\nguage (PDDL). We leverage the strengths of both\nthe techniques by using an LLM for generating\nthe PDDL representation (task PDDL) of planning\ntask requests followed by using a classical plan-\nner for computing a plan. Unlike previous ap-\nproaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs\ndirectly, our approach comprises of (a) translate:\nusing an LLM only for generating a logically in-\nterpretable intermediate representation of natural\nlanguage task descriptions, (b) infer: deriving ad-\nditional logically dependent information from the\nintermediate representation using a logic reasoner\n(currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and\n(c)compile: generating the target task PDDL from\nthe base and inferred information. We observe that\nusing an LLM to only output the intermediate rep-\nresentation significantly reduces LLM errors. Con-\nsequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one\nLLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for\nall seven domains of our evaluation dataset.\n1 Introduction\nCustomers of large organizations have a variety of ques-\ntions or requests (collectively known as queries in the fol-\nlowing) pertaining to the organization’s domain of opera-\ntion. Providing accurate responses to such user queries re-\nquires a thorough analysis of the user’s context, product fea-\ntures, domain knowledge, and organizational policies. Cer-\ntain user queries such as how-to questions and state chang-\ning requests require dynamic composition of possible actions\n(i.e., planning). Recently, transformer-based large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown wide success on many natural\nlanguage understanding and translation tasks, also demon-\nstrating some general reasoning and planning capability on\ndiverse tasks without having to be retrained [Ahn et al. , 2022;\nFigure 1: An overview of planning based response generation\nHuang et al. , 2022; Zeng et al. , 2022 ]. However, LLMs\nare known to perform only shallow reasoning and cannot\nfind complex plans [Valmeekam et al. , 2023b; Valmeekam\net al. , 2023a; OpenAI, 2023 ]. On the other hand, classical\nplanners can scale better in the number of actions they sup-\nport without compromising on the accuracy [Sohrabi, 2019;\nHelmert, 2006b ].\nWe address the problem of responding to planning related\nqueries by combining the strengths of LLMs and classical\nplanners. Figure 1 illustrates a high level overview of this pro-\ncess. The work presented in [Liuet al. , 2023 ]has shown that,\nfor classical planning tasks, using an LLM to generate the\ntask PDDL from a natural language planning task description\nand then using an external classical planner to compute a plan\nyields better performance than relying solely on an LLM for\nend to end planning. However, their approach, which is based\non in-context examples, does not achieve acceptable accu-\nracy, in particular, for slightly complex planning domains.\nOne of the primary reasons for failure is that the LLM of-\nten makes errors generating information that must abide by\nthe constraints specified in the domain knowledge or the task\ndescription.\nThroughout this paper, we use the seven planning do-\nmains presented in [Liu et al. , 2023 ].

What are the main stages involved in the LLM A* path-planning framework?,"['Fig. 3: Path planning through conversation.\nRL. For LLM A*, we have considered two variants, i.e.,\n1) only consider the heuristic h(s)as the cost function,\ndenoted as Greedy LLM A*; 2) consider the combination of\nthe cumulative and heuristic costs f(s)as the cost function,\ndenoted as LLM A*. The GPT3.5-turbo-16k LLM is used as\nit provides more tokens than GPT3.5-turbo or even GPT4.\nThis is to ensure that we can get the planning results without\ndisruption, not necessarily that the algorithm needs so many\ntokens. The GPT-3.5-turbo-16k LLM model we used allows\na total of 16,384 tokens. In comparison, GPT-3.5-turbo has\na maximum number of 4,096 tokens. In case there is a\nneed to reduce the consumption of tokens to replicate the\nexperiments, one can reset the request dictionary to null after\neach interaction. To enable full control/access to the planning\nprocess, one can split a single interaction process into two\nstages: 1) planning by LLM A*; and 2) outputs of necessary\nresults upon requests.\nAn occupancy grid map with a size 32 ×32 is primarily\nused for evaluation. There are free spaces and obstacles on\nthe map, where a robot agent can only move in free space\nand needs to avoid colliding with obstacles. The agent can\nmove in eight directions at maximum wherever and whenever\nit is safe. All experiments are carried out using Python 3.8+\non Google Colab.\nThe RL model we used is based on the PPO configuration,\ntogether with the standard A* are used for comparison.\nB. LLM A* Training and Session Design\nFor experiments that involve LLM, there are two stages\nincluding initialization where essential information about the\nenvironment and the agent will be prompted to set up plan-\nning. The information includes 1) locations of the start and\ngoal states; 2) obstacle distribution; 3) agent action space; 4)\nChebyshev distance measurement that is used for cumulative\nand heuristic costs calculation; and 5) the objective to plan\na path for the agent between the start and goal states. Inaddition, some planning rules can be communicated to LLM\nas well, which include 1) a viable path should avoid colliding\nwith obstacles; 2) the path should ideally expand along the\ndirection from heuristics or human guidance; 3) selection\nof the suitable actions that could accelerate the planning\nprocess.\nIn the second interactive planning stage, LLM can return\nplanning results based on the initial information and other\nprompts to help humans guide or monitor the planning.\nThis stage works iteratively and interactively until a path\nis successfully planned. It is worth noting that humans\ncan request intermediate planning results at any stage. This\nmakes the planning process a white box to humans, which\nhelps to assure safety, etc.\nC. RL Model Training\nThe PPO model is employed for comparison. In our case,\nthe PPO model is based on an actor-critic structure that\nincludes two 3-layer deep neural networks for policy and\nvalue training, respectively. The model is trained for over\n8,000,000 steps (a total of more than 8,000 episodes) to\nensure convergence.\nOn the other hand, we set the learning rates of both\nactor and critic to be smaller than 0.0005 to ensure that\nthe model won’t be fixed too early, achieving a balance of\nexploration and exploitation in contrast to the entropy penalty\nfor convergence.\nWe have also randomised the start state in each episode,\nto improve the adaptability of the PPO model to different\nenvironments. This is achieved by proposing to use of an\neasy-to-difficult mechanism to train the PPO model. To be\nspecific, we start from the states near the goal in which the\nagent is so close to it that ideally, it can reach the goal in\none step. Next, a state will be randomly chosen from these\nstates to train the PPO model. As the model only has a small\nscope of the map, it will be ‘easy’ to converge. After that,', 'Fig. 2: Setting the scene through conversation.\nD. LLM A* for Path Planning\nLLM A* is an LLM-based path-planning framework in-\nspired by A* and RL, to utilise commonsense knowledge\nof LLMs to achieve few-shot, code-free, and near-optimal\npath planning for robotics. LLMs are considered code-\nfree implicit policy learners, that learn from environment\ninformation encoded in a graph G= (S,A), and rewards\nfrom the cost function shown in equation (2) as well as from\nhumans that are communicated to LLMs through prompts,\nto achieve near-optimal path planning.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, building an LLM A* model comprises\nmainly two stages. The first stage is ‘teaching’ an LLM to\nbe aware of the environment the agent is in and the motions\nit can perform, which are encoded in a graph G= (S,A).\nThe start and target nodes (ss,sg)∈S, heuristics, and any\nother relevant rules are also communicated to the LLM. One\nexample of communicating such information to the LLM is\ngiven in Fig. 2.The second stage is the path planning stage. With the\nnecessary information in mind, the LLM will try to plan\na path between the initial state ssand the goal state sg. As\nprompts are used to communicate with the LLM, humans\ncould be needed in the planning stage for two reasons:\n1) guide the LLM only to communicate necessary infor-\nmation back to humans, which will save costly tokens; 2)\nprovide guidance/heuristics when necessary to accelerate the\nplanning process. The prompts will also enable humans to\nquery about the planning process whenever and wherever\nnecessary, to make the whole planning process a white box\nto humans. Fig. 3 shows how path planning is delivered by\n‘chatting’ with the LLM.\nIV. E XPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA.

How is node feature initialization performed in the context of GNN training?,"['following section, we will elaborate in more detail on how to\nintegrate the LLM-based pseudo-label propagation into GNN\ntraining and train the whole model in an end-to-end manner.\nC. Node Feature Initialization and GNN Training\nIn order to perform node feature initialization, we employ\nthe pre-trained LM DeBERTa-base [ 15] to encode the text\nattribute xiof the node viinto the vectorial feature, i.e.,\nhi= LM( xi), v i∈ V, xi∈ X, (6)\nwhere hiis the text embedding for the node vi,LM(·)\nrepresents the LM model DeBERTa-base.

How does watermarking help in monitoring the use of large language models (LLMs)?,"['itive rate.

Through a chat interface, re-\nsearchers like Jannai et al. (2023); Jones and\nBergen (2023) have explored how well people can\ndistinguish between a human and an LLM. This\ndistinction is vital for the safety and reliability of\nan application. Though related, our BBIV task fo-\ncuses on identifying a specific LLM model used by\nan application, rather than differentiating between\nhuman and machine.\nDetection of LLM content. Researchers have in-\nvestigated ways to identify content created by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), particularly since Chat-\nGPT became popular. This effort is key to maintain-\ning originality and preventing LLMs from reusing\ntheir previous outputs. Various methods have been\ndeveloped: Mitchell et al. (2023) looked into the\nmodel’s probability characteristics; Gehrmann et al.\n(2019) examined the statistical properties of texts;\nChen et al. (2023) used classifiers to tell apart con-\ntent made by humans from that made by LLMs.\nThere has also been debate on the feasibility of\nthese detection tasks against deliberate manipula-\ntion efforts (Sadasivan et al., 2023; Chakraborty\net al., 2023). For further details, the surveys by\nDhaini et al. (2023); Ghosal et al. (2023) provide\na thorough review. While these studies focus on\ndistinguishing between human and LLM-generated\ntexts, our BBIV task targets the identification of\nspecific LLM models behind applications. Unlike\nthe broad text analysis for LLM content detection,\nBBIV utilizes an interactive approach, demonstrat-\ning that with well-crafted prompts, it is feasible to\npinpoint an LLM type based on minimal output,\nwithin 3 to 5 characters of output text.Watermarking. Watermarking is a promising\nstrategy that could help solve the problem we have\nhighlighted. It embeds subtle statistical distortions\nin the output of a model, which a specialized de-\ntection algorithm can use to confirm whether the\ncontent was generated by our model. These distor-\ntions are designed to be imperceptible to humans.\nWatermarking typically occurs during the model’s\ntraining phase (Abdelnabi and Fritz, 2021; Kirchen-\nbauer et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023), though there\nare methods that apply watermarks during the con-\ntent generation phase as well (Kirchenbauer et al.,\n2023). Regardless of when it is applied, the model,\ncomplete with watermarks, eventually gets passed\nto third-party developers before being released to\nthe public. This introduces a major challenge for\nmonitoring LLMs in use: once an LLM is deployed\nwithout watermarking, it is too late to start tracking\nits use. Our solution, TRAP, is free of this lim-\nitation. We create prompts specifically designed\nto coax the desired LLM into producing certain\nresponses. These prompts can be developed even\nafter the model has been deployed, as long as the\noriginal developers can access the model’s original\nweights. We contend that TRAP is a fundamen-\ntally more practical solution. However, we note\nthat TRAP is not intended to replace watermarking.\nInstead, it complements it, acting as an additional\nlayer in an overarching security model.\nAdversarial suffix. Despite efforts to align the\noutputs of LLMs with human goals and ethics (Yud-\nkowsky, 2016; Christian, 2020; Christiano et al.,\n2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Rafailov et al., 2023;\nTunstall et al., 2023; Fernandes et al., 2023), there\nis a risk of LLMs being manipulated to generate\nharmful content through “jailbreaking” using ad-\nversarial suffixes. Zou et al. (2023) introduced the\nGreedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) method, which\nidentifies prompt suffixes capable of eliciting neg-\native behaviors from aligned LLMs. This method,\nfor instance, can trick an LLM into starting its re-\nsponse with affirmative (e.g. “Sure, here’s how”)\nto dangerous queries (e.g. “Tell me how to destroy\nhumanity”), pushing it towards generating unsafe\ncontent. Subsequent work (Hu et al., 2024) has ex-\nplored using GCG for exploring further vulnerabil-\nities. Our approach, TRAP, is the first to repurpose\nGCG for a constructive and socially beneficial goal.\nWe employ GCG to discover suffixes that prompt a\nspecific LLM to produce a predetermined response.\nThis technique serves as a compliance verification']",Watermarking helps in monitoring the use of large language models (LLMs) by embedding subtle statistical distortions in the output of a model. These distortions are imperceptible to humans but can be detected by a specialized detection algorithm to confirm whether the content was generated by the model.

How have LLMs contributed to the study of cognitive and behavioral psychology?,"[""psychological research and provides insights into interpreting these models from a psychological standpoint, \ncontributing to their safety and interpretability.  \n \n2. LLMs in cognitive and behavioral psychology  \n Within  multilevel time scales of human behavior  (Newell, 1990) , cognitive and behavioral psychology \nhas focused primarily on the study of cognitive processes on sub -hourly time scales (see Fig. 1), which \nencompass humans engaging in perception, memory, thinking, decision -making, problem -solving , and \nconscious planning. Cognitive and behavioral psychology typically employs experimental methods to study \nthese cognitive processes by controlling and observing behaviors and responses under specific conditions. \nThe recent emergence of LLMs  has reinvigorated the discussion a s to whether human cognitive abilities are \nrevealed in these LLMs  given sufficient training data. If the answer is yes, then it would be possible to study \nthe cognitive processes of LLMs , thereby gaining knowledge of human cognitive processes and forming a \nvaluable addition to existing research methods in cognitive psychology.  \n  Binz and Schulz (2023a)  found that fine -tuning multiple tasks enabled the LLM  to predict human \nbehavior in previously unseen tasks, suggesting that the LLM  can be adapted to become a generalist \ncognitive model. In another study, they tested the GPT -3 with tools from cognitive psychology and showed \nthat it made better decisions and outperformed humans in a multiarmed bandit task (Binz & Schulz, 2023b) . \nIn addition, there are other series of studies that have demonstrated that LLMs  have perceptual judgment  \n(Marjieh et al., 2023) , reasoning  (Webb et al., 2023) , and decision -making abilities  (Hagendorff et al., 2023) , \ncreativity  (Stevenson et al., 2022) , and problem -solving  (Orru et al., 2023) , and one study even demonstrated \nthat the GPT -4 has the mental abilities of a seven -year-old child through a false belief task (considered the \ngold standard for testing theory of mind in humans)  (Kosinski, 2023) . For example, Hagendorff et al. (2023)  \nexplored reasoning capabilities and decision -making processes of the OpenAI GPT family by the following \nexperimental method: Design a series of semantic illusion and cognitive reflection tests designed to elicit \nintuitive but erroneous responses. Apply th ese tasks, traditionally used to study human reasoning and \ndecision -making, to OpenAI's family of generative pre -trained Transformer models.

How does the complementarity between humans and LLMs improve performance in tasks involving weaker models?,"['interesting direction to pursue (Bansal et al., 2021;\nMa et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Note that this\ncomplementarity can occur between humans and\na variety of LLMs. For example, P3 in Iterative\nProcess found that while using a weaker model\neither alone or in a pipeline resulted in poor perfor-\nmance, “when I provided examples from a stronger\nmodel as the previous examples [for the weaker\nmodel to iterate on], the performance dramatically\nimproved. ” This observation reflects that even less-\nstate-of-the-art models can be e ffective teammates\nif given the appropriate task — “All models are\nwrong, but some are useful.” (Box, 1976).\n4.4 Replication Challenge: Multi-Modal\nRegulations vs. Textual Instructions\nWhen reflecting on challenges in LLM replication,\nfour students mentioned the di fficulty of creating\nstructured input /output formats. For example, P7\n(replicating Find-Fix-Verify ) described including a\nconstraint in their prompt: “These segments need\nto be present in the text.” They stressed its impor-\ntance in the reflection: “Without this prompt, the\nreturned segments are often sentences dramatically\nrestructured based on the original text, making it\ndifficult to insert them back into the original text\nafter the fix step. ” Similarly, P6 in Task Paraphrase\nsaid“the major weakness of these prompts was the\nchallenge of extracting structured information out,\nespecially for the pipeline models. ”\nIt is worth considering why human workers,\nwho are as (if not more) “generative” as LLMs, are\ncapable of producing structured inputs and outputs.\nEssentially, all of the LLM replications of crowd-\nsourcing pipelines are partial — the assignment\nfocuses only on replicating the instructions of the\ncrowdsourcing pipeline, while other components of\ncrowdsourcing are disregarded. Specifically, nearly\nall crowdsourcing pipelines inherently include\nconstraints introduced by the user interface. For\nexample, in Find-Fix-Verify , the Find step prompts\ncrowdworkers to identify areas for abbreviation\nthrough mouse selection on text , guaranteeing that\nthe segment is precisely extracted from the original\ndocument. Similarly, He et al. (2015) required\nannotators to label their questions and answers\nin a spreadsheet interface with limited answer\nlength and predetermined question options. These\nensure that all the answers can be short phrases\ntopredictable questions . Meanwhile, since LLM\nmodules /workers are solely driven by textualinstructions, they need additional regulation to\ncompensate for the absence of UI restrictions.\nSome students o ffered textual versions of syn-\ntactic constraints, e.g., “a prompting system that\nallows for much stricter templates (such as the use\nof a [MASK] token) would make crowdwork-style\npipelines much easier. ” (P11, Iterative Process ).\nOther ways might also be possible, e.g., transform-\ning generative tasks into multiple-choice tasks so\nthe LLM only outputs a single selection.\nReflection: Alignment in instruction modal-\nity, and its role in human simulation. With\nthe emergence of multi-modal foundation mod-\nels (OpenAI, 2023; Ramesh et al., 2022), it be-\ncomes crucial to not only contemplate the align-\nment between humans and models in terms of in-\nstruction following but also to explore the optimal\nmodality of instruction that aligns with human in-\ntuition. For example, while LLMs have automated\nsome interactions with visualization, prior work\nhas found that users need mouse events to resolve\nvague references in their natural language com-\nmands (“make this bar blue” (Wang et al., 2022c;\nKumar et al., 2017)). Instead of converting such\nactions into textual instructions, it would be more\nadvantageous to shift towards utilizing visual anno-\ntations.\nSuch challenges also have an impact on the prac-\ntical applications of LLMs. In the ongoing dis-\ncussions regarding whether LLMs can faithfully\nsimulate humans, researchers have begun investi-\ngating the feasibility of using LLMs as pilot study\nusers for e fficiently refining study instructions and\ndesigns (Hämäläinen et al., 2023). Indeed, this di-\nrection is valuable — Just like in Figure 2, both\nhumans and LLMs need “prompting” to complete\ntasks. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that such\na transition may not be straightforward: On the one\nhand, since LLMs only respond to textual instruc-\ntions, an important post-processing step might be\nrequired to map LLM instructions into multi-modal\nconstraints for humans. For example, instruction\n“extract exact sentences” might need to be mapped\nto an interface design that involves selecting spe-\ncific phrases, and “paraphrase the main idea” would\nrequire disabling copy-pasting from the text to dis-\ncourage direct repetition and encourage users to\nprovide their own input. On one other hand, as\nmentioned in Section 4.3, LLMs and humans may\nrespond di fferently to the same instructions. This\ndiscrepancy makes LLMs unreliable even for sim-']","The complementarity between humans and LLMs improves performance in tasks involving weaker models by providing examples from a stronger model for the weaker model to iterate on, which dramatically improves the performance.",simple,"[{'page_label': '10', 'file_name': '2307.10168v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2307.10168v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1432220, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How do LLM-Powered Conversational Voice Assistants handle generic and specific questions in medical self-diagnosis and creative planning scenarios?,"['LLM-Powered Conversational Voice Assistants 15\nfood?” After the participant responds, the assistant acknowledges with comments such as “Interesting” or\n“Thanks for sharing” before transitioning back to deliver the originally requested information. There are 52\n(5.37%of interaction turns) instances of a long wait pattern in the interaction data; see Fig. 5(5). We note that\nall small talk questions were answered by participants; in fact, participants sometimes answered the question\nintended as small talk by fully engaging with it. For instance, one participant stays in character (i.e., pretending\nto be sick) when asked about their typical day: “Right now, it’s not much because I’m too sick to do anything\nand I could really use this help with the name of the cough [syrup] brands.”\nBelow, we explore interaction patterns specific to each scenario; we address patterns that arise both at the onset of\nthe task and as each scenario progresses. Conversations ended with the end-intent→closing pattern for all three tasks.\n4.2 Medical Self-Diagnosis Interaction Patterns\nThe medical self-diagnois task was usually initiated by a participant’s cough being recognized as intent. As the task\nprogressed, we identified two recurring patterns; both patterns emerge from question-answer pairs, see Fig. 6.\n4.2.1 Question: generic →Answer: factual + statement: warning. In our medical information-seeking scenario, most\nquestions that were formulated as generic (𝑁=144) were handled by the VA with a factual response, see Fig. 6(1). The\nVA’s response was also generally followed by a warning statement such as “However, it’s important to consult a doctor\nor pharmacist ...” See C7 in Table 5 for an example of the question: generic→answer: factual + statement: warning\ninteraction pattern. We also observed that participants asked follow-up questions throughout the scenario.\n4.2.2 Question: specific →Answer: refusal + statement: warning. In our medical self-diagnosis scenario, when partic-\nipants sought the VA’s advice on topics such as specific medication choices or the best medicines available, the VA\ndid not provide a direct answer and instead offered a warning (𝑁=15) (see Fig. 6(2)). Faced with this, participants\neither pressed the VA by rewording or repeating their question ( 𝑁=6) or proceeded to a different query ( 𝑁=9). For\nexample, in conversation C8 (Table 5), the participant rephrases their question two times in an attempt to obtain specific\nbrand recommendations for cough medicines containing expectorants. Eventually, the VA offers a factual response that\nmentions some brand names, but also includes a cautionary warning urging the user to consult an expert.\n4.3 Creative Planning Interaction Patterns\nThe trip planning scenario usually started with participants’ intent to start the conversation (initiation) as shown in Fig.\n5(1). We identified two patterns specific to the creative planning scenario; both patterns emerge from question-answer\npairs (see Fig. 7) during the progression of task. We note that participants asked follow-up questions in both patterns.\n4.3.1 Question: generic →Answer: factual, descriptive. During planning their day, when the participants posed broad,\ngeneral questions to the VA—such as asking recommendations of sights to see or places to dine—or when they sought\nthe VA’s personal opinion on such topics, the VA responded in a descriptive style (𝑁=123, see Fig. 7(1). The objectivity\nof a question (factual oropinion) did not affect the VA’s response. See C9 and C10 (Table 6) for examples of this pattern.\n4.3.2 Question: specific →Answer: factual, directive. In the creative planning scenario, when participants mapped out\ntheir day and posed specific queries—such as asking directions to a place or about its operating hours—the VA replied\nin adirective style of communication ( 𝑁=97), see Fig. 7(2). For example, in conversation C11 (Table 6), the participant\nsought directions from point A to point B and the VA simply provided those directions.\nManuscript submitted to ACM']","In medical self-diagnosis scenarios, LLM-Powered Conversational Voice Assistants handle generic questions with a factual response followed by a warning statement, and specific questions with a refusal followed by a warning statement.

What is the role of the LIBRO framework in enhancing developer efficiency during the bug reproduction process?,"['IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 43\nto establish the similarity between reports and categorize\nthem as duplicate or distinct bug reports. Notably, ChatGPT\nshows significant potential in DBRD.\nFor example, in 2023, Zhang et al. [163] introduce a\nmethod named Cupid, which integrates the traditional\nDBRD approach REP with ChatGPT. Cupid utilizes Chat-\nGPT in a zero-shot setting to extract key information from\nbug reports, which is then used as input for REP to detect\nduplicate bug reports. Evaluation across three datasets re-\nveals that Cupid achieves a new state-of-the-art level, with\nRecall Rate@10 scores ranging from 0.59 to 0.67. Specifically,\nCupid improves Recall Rate@10 by 6.7% to 8.7% over pre-\nvious state-of-the-art methods on these datasets. Moreover,\nCupid’s performance surpasses that of deep learning meth-\nods, reaching up to 79.2%.\nMeanwhile, Plein et al. [164] conduct empirical research,\nas outlined in [164], on how to utilize ChatGPT to transform\nuser-provided software defect reports into formal test case\nspecifications. They employ ChatGPT to generate test cases\nand evaluate the executability and validity of these gener-\nated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate the sig-\nnificant potential of ChatGPT in converting informal defect\nreports into formal test cases, holding crucial implications\nfor automated software testing and defect resolution tasks.\n4.4.7 Bug reproduction\nBug reproduction is a part of the software bug-fixing pro-\ncess, aimed at resolving issues within the software by repro-\nducing and locally replicating the environment where the\ninitial bug occurred. This is a highly collaborative process,\nin which software developers use reproduction steps from\nusers, software screenshots, tracking logs, and other issue\ndescriptions as information sources [183]. Bug reproduction\nholds significant importance in software maintenance, but\nthe challenge of replicating the client-side context makes it\nan obstacle in software development. This process requires\na human-centric approach for research and comprehension\nto design tools that can address the challenges faced by\ndevelopers in the bug reproduction process.\nKang et al. [165] introduce a framework named LIBRO,\nwhich utilizes LLMs to generate potential test cases from\nbug reports and subsequently ranks and suggests these\ngenerated solutions through post-processing steps. When\nevaluating LIBRO on the Defects4J benchmark, Kang et al.\nfind that LIBRO produces failure-reproducing test cases for\n33% of the studied cases. Moreover, it initially generates\na bug-reproducing test for 149 defects. To minimize the\npossibility of data contamination, they further evaluate 31\nbug reports submitted after the collection of LLM training\ndata. LIBRO generates bug-reproducing tests for 32% of the\ninvestigated bug reports. Overall, experimental results indi-\ncate that LIBRO significantly enhances developer efficiency\nby automatically generating tests from bug reports.\n4.4.8 Bug Reply\nBug replay refers to the process of reproducing or recre-\nating software defects or issues based on the information\nprovided in a bug report. A bug report is a document that\ndescribes the problems encountered by users while using\nthe software, detailing what happened, what was expected\nto happen, and sometimes including the steps to reproducethe issue. The process of bug replay is crucial for software\nmaintenance as it enables developers to understand, repli-\ncate, and fix the defects reported.\nTraditional bug replay methods often rely on manual\nsteps where developers follow the instructions in the bug\nreport to reproduce the issue. However, researchers have\nexplored automated bug replay methods to expedite and\nstreamline this process. These methods leverage technolo-\ngies such as NLP and Machine Learning to extract relevant\ninformation from bug reports and guide the software in\nautomatically reproducing the reported defects. The use of\nLLMs represents an advancement in bug replay, enhancing\nthe capabilities of automated approaches.\nIn 2023, Feng et al. [166] propose a lightweight approach\nAdbGPT to automatically reproduce Andriod bugs from\nbug reports without any training. AdbGPT contains two\nmain phases: the Steps to Reproduce (S2R) Entity Extraction\nphase and the Guided Replay phase. During the initial\nphase, they provides ChatGPT with details regarding en-\ntity specifications and available actions, as well as action\nprimitives. Then, they apply chain-of-thought reasoning to\ninstruct ChaGPT to generate a coherent series of intermedi-\nate steps that lead to a reasonable output. After that, given\na test bug report as the test prompt, they query for the S2R\nentities and ChaGPT will consistently generate a numeric\nlist to represent the extracted S2R in the same format as\nthe example output. In the second phase, they first transfer\nthe GUIs into domain-specific prompts that ChaGPT can\nunderstand by converting the view hierarchy of the GUI\nscreen into HTML text. Then, they prompt ChaGPT which\nis adopted with chain-of-thought reasoning to generate the\ntarget component to operate on, ultimately triggering the\nbug. They evaluate the performance of AdbGPT with ReC-\nDroid and MaCa. Results show that AdbGPT is significantly\nbetter than that of other baselines in all metrics, i.e.,, on av-\nerage 39.3%, and 42.2% more accurate in step extraction and\nentity extraction compared with the best baseline (MaCa).\nIn addition, they find that applying few-shot learning and\nchain-of thought which provide examples with intermediate\nreasons, can endow ChatGPT with a better understanding\nof the task, resulting in a boost of performance up to 90.8%.\nTheir further analysis shows that chain-of-thought leads to\na substantial improvement on guided replay ( i.e.,, 18.8%\nboost) in the performance of AdbGPT, indicating that the\nLLMs can better understand the task by processing it step-\nby-step.\n4.4.9 Test Update\nTest update refers to the process of modifying existing test\ncases to align them with recent changes in the production\ncode. This is a crucial aspect of maintaining the quality and\nrelevance of software tests throughout the software lifecycle.\nTest updates are necessary because as the production code\nevolves to incorporate new features, fix bugs, or adapt to\nnew requirements, the corresponding test cases must also\nbe revised to ensure they accurately assess the software’s\nfunctionality and performance.\nHu et al. [167] propose CEPROT, a method based on\nCodeT5, aimed at automatically identifying and updating\ntest cases that become obsolete due to changes in pro-\nduction code. It includes two stages: identifying outdated']",The LIBRO framework enhances developer efficiency during the bug reproduction process by utilizing LLMs to generate potential test cases from bug reports and subsequently ranking and suggesting these generated solutions through post-processing steps.

What does a larger value of opinion convergence time indicate about the interaction process of opinions?,"["" 16 / 21 \n \n 𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓=∑∑(𝑥𝑖(𝑇)−𝑥𝑖(0))𝑛\n𝑖=1 𝑠∈𝑆\n𝑆𝑛(5) \nWhere 𝑆 represents the number of simulations, 𝑛 represents the number of specific categor y of \nnodes, 𝑥𝑖(𝑇) and 𝑥𝑖(0) represent the final value and initial value of node 𝑖.  \nOpinion convergence time is the time step it takes for an agent's opinion to evolve to a stable \nstate. In this study, we categorize three types of nodes and compute  their average opinion \nconvergence t ime. The larger the value, the longer the average opinion convergence time of that \ntype of node, i.e., the longer it takes for the opinion o to reach a stable state, and the more intense \nand chaotic the interaction process of opinions.  The formula of mean opinion convergence time  \n(𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣) is as follow s. \n𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑣=∑(𝑡| ∀𝑖,|𝑥𝑖(𝑡)−𝑥𝑖(𝑡−1)|≤𝜏 𝑠∈𝑆 )\n𝑆(6) \nWhere (𝑡| ∀𝑖,|𝑥𝑖(𝑡)−𝑥𝑖(𝑡−1)|≤𝜏)  means f or all nodes belonging to the same specific \ncategory of nodes , if the difference between their value at time  𝑡 and their value at time 𝑡−1 is \nless than 𝜏 , We take 𝜏  to be five thousandths of 1, i.e. 0.005 , the time 𝑡  is taken as their \nconvergence time.  \nOpinion standard deviation is the degree of dispersion of a group's opinions relative to the \nmean  value . In this study, we categorize three types of nodes and compute  their average opinion \nstandard deviation. The larger the value, the more discrete the overall distribution of opinions of the \nnodes is relative to the mean, i.e., the wider the o verall distribution of opinions. The formula of \nmean opinion standard deviation  (𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐸𝑆𝐷) is as follow s. \n𝑁𝑂𝐷𝐸𝑆𝐷=∑√∑(𝑥𝑖(𝑇)−𝑥̅(𝑇))2𝑛\n𝑖=1\n𝑛−1𝑠∈𝑆\n𝑆(7) \nWhere 𝑥̅(𝑇) represents the mean final value of a specific category of nodes.  \nThe number of opinion clusters can effectively compensate for the lack of standard deviation \nin portraying data distribution, for example, the standard deviation is large when the opinions are \npolarized, but the opinions are concentrated. Therefore, we introduce the num ber of opinion clusters \nto indicate the degree of opinion aggregation. The larger the value, the more points the opinion \ndistribution of the node is concentrated, i.e., the more the overall opinion distribution tends to be \nsplit, and a value of 2 indicates  that the opinion distribution of the node is polarized, a value of 1 \nindicates that the opinion distribution of the node is consensus.  \nThe commonly used K -means clustering method needs to specify the number of categories k \nin advance, which obviously does  not meet our needs  because the final distribution of opinions \ncannot be specified in advance , and density -based clustering methods, such as DBSCAN, do not \ntake well into account the fragmentation  of opinion, so  we apply single linkage hierarchical  \ncluster ing, which can compensate the defects of the above two clustering methods , and is an \nagglomerative clustering  algorithm that builds trees in a bottom -up approach62,63. Specifically,  we \nfirst take the  𝑥𝑖(𝑇) obtained from a single simulatio n, i.e., the final opinion value of each agent, as \na separate cluster  𝐶𝑖, and then calculate the distance between clusters using the Manhattan distance \n(see Eq.

How does the technique L IBRO utilize a pretrained LLM to analyze bug reports and generate prospective tests?,"['16\n9 C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduce L IBRO , a technique that uses a\npretrained LLM to analyze bug reports, generate prospec-\ntive tests, and finally rank and suggest the generated solu-\ntions based on a number of simple statistics.

How are LLMs used for evaluation in the context of assessing conversation quality?,"['REFERENCES 21\nthat respondents rate on a scale in terms of how well they describe their own\nbehavior or characteristics. The BFI is valued for its balance between brevity\nand comprehensive coverage of the five-factor model. It demonstrates good\nreliability and validity, making it a trusted tool in personality assessment.\n6.5 Model-human agreement evaluation\nTo confirm that the assessment methods based on LLMs are overall reasonable\nand consistent with human judgement, we sample the responses generated by\nthese models and hire humans to evaluate them. We presented the answer pairs\ngenerated by the LLMs to 20 native English-speaking participants globally\n(10 male) recruited from Prolific (www.prolific.co), and paid each participants\n£15. The average reward per hour for the participants is £14.59. The average\nparticipants age was 32.9 ±20.1. In the experiment, we sampled seven tasks,\nresulting in 84 pairs of questions and answers, which means there are 84 trails.\nThese pairs consist of answers from different models to the same question\nwithin the same task, and are presented to the participants.\nOn each trail of the task, participants were asked to make a binary deci-\nsion about which of the two answers is more creativity according to the given\ncriteria. Participants also have the option to choose that there is no significant\ndifference in creativity between the two responses. A progress bar at the top of\nthe screen indicated to participants how many trails they had completed and\nhad remaining to complete. After obtaining the final human evaluation data,\nwe calculate the consistency between the human assessment results and those\nof the LLMs. We use Kendall’s coefficient and Spearman’s coefficient for this\ncalculation. Since the participants’ data is based on relative win-loss relation-\nships, we need to preprocess the human evaluation results. For tie results, we\nconvert the human assessment results to the average score two answers evalu-\nated by LLM; for non-tie results, we assign the higher score evaluated by the\nLLM to the winning response in the human results. Under these conditions,\nthe calculated Kendall’s coefficient and Spearman’s coefficient are 0.4996 and\n0.5564, respectively. These values are quite usable for automated evaluation\ntechniques.\nReferences\n[1] Bubeck, S. et al.

Using LLMs for evaluation offers efficiency, versatility, reduced reliance\non human annotation, and the capability of evaluating multiple dimensions of conversation quality\nin a single model call, which improves scalability. However, potential issues include a lack of\nestablished validation, which can lead to bias or accuracy problems if the LLM used for evaluation\nis not thoroughly vetted. The decision process to identify suitable LLMs and decoding strategies\ncan be complex and pivotal to obtaining accurate evaluations. The range of evaluation may also be\nlimited, as the focus is often on open-domain conversations, possibly leaving out assessments in\nspecific or narrow domains. While reducing human input can be beneficial, it can also miss out on\ncrucial interaction quality aspects better evaluated by human judges, such as emotional resonance\nor nuanced understandings.\nGPTScore. [69] is a new evaluation framework designed to assess the quality of output from\ngenerative AI models. To provide these evaluations, GPTScore taps into the emergent capabilities of\n19 different pre-trained models, such as zero-shot instruction, and uses them to judge the generated\ntexts. These models vary in scale from 80M to 175B. Testing across four text generation tasks, 22\naspects of evaluation, and 37 related datasets, has demonstrated that GPTScore can effectively\nevaluate text per instructions in natural language. This attribute allows it to sidestep challenges\ntraditionally encountered in text evaluation, like the need for sample annotations and achieving\ncustom, multi-faceted evaluations.\nGPT-judge. [147] is a finetuned model based on the GPT-3-6.7B, which is trained to evaluate\nthe truthfulness of answers to questions in the TruthfulQA dataset. The training set consists of\ntriples in the form of question-answer-label combinations, where the label can be either true or\nfalse. The model’s training set includes examples from the benchmark and answers generated by\nother models assessed by human evaluation. In its final form, the GPT-judge uses examples from\nall models to evaluate the truthfulness of responses. This training includes all questions from the\ndataset, with the goal being to evaluate truth, not generalize new questions.\nThe study conducted by the authors [ 147] focuses on the application of GPT-judge in assessing\nTruthfulness andInformativeness using the TruthfulQA Dataset. The authors undertook the fine-\ntuning of two distinct GPT-3 models to evaluate two essential aspects: Truthfulness, which pertains\nto the accuracy and honesty of information provided by the LLM, and Informativeness, which\nmeasures how effectively the LLM conveys relevant and valuable information in its responses.\nFrom these two fundamental concepts, the authors derived a combined metric denoted as truth *\ninfo. This metric represents the product of scalar scores for both truthfulness and informativeness.\nIt not only quantifies the extent to which questions are answered truthfully but also incorporates\nthe assessment of informativeness for each response. This comprehensive approach prevents the\nmodel from generating generic responses like ""I have no comment"" and ensures that responses are\nnot only truthful but also valuable. These metrics have found widespread deployment in evaluating\nthe factuality of information generated by LLMs [35, 139].\nLLM-Eval. [148] is a novel evaluation methodology for open-domain dialogues with LLMs. Unlike\nconventional evaluation methods which rely on human annotations, ground-truth responses, or\nmultiple LLM prompts, LLM-Eval uses a unique prompt-based evaluation process employing a\nunified schema to assess various elements of a conversation’s quality during a single model function.\nACM Comput.

How do political biases in LLMs potentially influence public opinion and societal discourse?,"['stage /s of the training pipeline used to create LLMs  optimized to follow users ’ instructions . Base or \nfoundation models answers to questions with political connotations, on average, do not appear to \nskew to the poles of the political spectrum.  That is, despite the likely unbalanced  representation of \npolitical viewpoints in the corpora used to pretrain base LLMs, this does not appear to immediately \ngive rise to consistent political biases on base models’ responses to political orientation tests.  \nAn important limitation of our analysis is that base model s’ responses to questions with political \nconnotations are often incoherent  or contradictory, creating thus a challenge for stance detection . \nThis is to be expected as base models are essentially train  to complete web documents, so they can \noften fail to generate appropriate response when prompted with a question/statement from a \npolitical orientation test.  This behavior is mitigated by the inclusion of a suffix such as “I select the \nanswer:” at the end of the prompt feeding a test item to the model. The addition of the suffix \ninduces the model towards selecting one of the  test’s  allowed answers. Such a mechanism is not \nalways successful  for base models and  the invalid response rate for this type of model  remains high. \nAlso , even when the stance detection classifies a model response as valid and maps the model \nresponse to one of the test’s allowed answers,  some of  those mappings would still be  classified as \nincorrect  by human raters . This is unavoidable and even human raters would also make mistakes at \nstance detection, perhaps even at a higher rate than ChatGPT  as suggested by recent evidence  [20]. \nFor all the reasons above , our results should be interpreted with caution. Yet, it is noteworthy that \ngiven the large number  of test items fed to base LLMs , 20,050 (401 questions/statements in all tests \n× 5 base models × 10 trials per model ), when probed with questions with political valence  and \nprimed to choose one of the test’s valid responses , the base models responses do not, on average, \nskew  to the poles of the political spectrum.  \nThese results tentatively suggest that the infusion of political preferences onto LLMs might be mainly \nhappening after the pretraining phase. This is surprising as one would expect that the training \ncorpora with which LLMs  are pretrained is probably not balanced  and some political viewpoints are \nlikely more prevalent than others. Hence,  it would be  reasonable to expect overrepresented  \nviewpoints in the pretraining corpus to be more likely to appear in base models ’ answers to \nquestions with political connotations. Yet, we do not observe such phenomena in our analysis.  \nWe s peculate that because the training corpora with which LLMs are pre -trained is so vast and \ncomprehensive , LLMs  are probably  able to accurately map a large portion of the political latent space \neven if some views are less frequently represented than others  in their pretraining corpora . Perhaps \na useful analogy to the phenomena described above is how despite the overrepresentation of \nEnglish language in the ir pretraining corpora, LLMs are quite  proficient in a variety of other \nlanguages that are underrepresented  in their pretraining data. That is,  LLMs are able to interpolate \nunder -sampled language  regions of the input space by leveraging or transfer learning the ir \ncontext ual understanding from other related regions of the input space.  \nIn a further set of analysis, w e also showed how with modest compute and politically customized \ntraining data we can align the political preferences of LLMs to target regions of the political spectrum \nvia supervised fine -tuning.  This provides further evidence for the potential role of  supervised  fine-\ntuning in the emergence of political preferences with in LLMs.  \nOur analysis cannot exclude the possibility that the preference for left -leaning responses that we \nobserve in most conversational LLMs might be a byproduct of content in the corpora used to pre -\ntrain those models  and which only emerges post -finetuning even when the fine -tuning process itself  \nmight be exquisitely politically neutral.  Though conceivable , the evidence presented in this work \ndoes not provide support for that hypothesis.  But our analysis and results cannot reject it neither.  ', 'We also do not want to claim that the fine -tuning or RL phases of LLMs training are trying to \nexplicitly inject political preferences into these models. Perhaps the emergence of consistent political \npreferences  in conversational LLMs  is a byproduct of  annotators ’ instructions and /or behaviors that \nwithout being explicitly politically aligned are however interpolated and generalized by the LLM to \nother  regions in the latent political space  due to some unknown cultural artifact . But it is noteworthy \nthat this is happening in LLMs created by a wide variety of organizations . \nAnother possible explanation for these results is that ChatGPT , as the pioneer LLM with widespread  \npopularity, has been leveraged to fine-tune other popular LLMs via synthetic data generation. The \nleft-leaning political preferences of ChatGPT  have been documented previously [4]. Perhaps  those \npreferences have percolated to other models that have leverage d in their training ChatGPT -\ngenerated synthetic data.  Yet, it would be surprising that all conversational LLMs tested in this work \nhave been trained using ChatGPT generated data as it is comparatively expensive to generate in \ncomparison to web -scraped corpora or that the weight of that component of their training data is so \nvast as to dominate the political orientations of every model  tested  in our analysis .  \nAn interesting test instrument outlier in our results has been the Nolan Test that consistently \ndiagnosed most LLMs answers to its questions as manifesting politically moderate viewpoints. The \nreasons for  the disparity in diagnosis between the Nolan Test and all the other tests instruments \nused in this work warrant s further investigation about the validity and reliability of political \norientation tests instruments.  \nTo conclude, t he emergence of large language models (LLMs) as  fundamental information  providers \nhas marked a significant shift in how people access and engage with information. Traditionally, \nindividuals have relied on search engines or platforms like Wikipedia for quick and reliable access to \nboth factual and biase d information. However, as LLMs become more advanced and accessible, they \nare beginning to displace these conventional sources. This transition raises critical concerns about \nthe potential political biases  embedded in LLMs. This shift in information sourcing has profound \nsocietal ramifications, as it can shape public opinion, influence voting behaviors, and affect the \noverall discourse in  society .

In recent years, a new paradigm\nof Induction Reasoning has been proposed by ( Cheng et al., 2023 ), which requires models to generate\ngeneral-purpose program code to solve a class of problems ba sed on given contextual questions and a\nspeciﬁc question. For example, Cheng et al. (2023 ),Jiang et al. (2023 ) and Sur´ ıs et al.

Recently,\nBills et al. (2023 ) has tested the inductive ability of GPT-4 ( OpenAI, 2023 ) to evaluate its effectiveness\nin inducing patterns that are difﬁcult for humans to express clearly. Intriguingly, Mankowitz et al.

On the oth er hand, benchmarks such as Wik-\niQA ( Yang et al., 2015 ), HotpotQA ( Yang et al., 2018 ), and SciFact ( Wadden et al., 2020 ) provide\nsentence-level coarse-grained textual segments as explan ations for model classiﬁcation results.\nERASER ( DeYoung et al., 2020 ) and FineIEB ( Wang et al., 2022b ) provide benchmarks for evaluating\nAbduction Reasoning with diverse granularity explanation s.

What is the purpose of the alignment fine-tuning process in the context of the LLM's response to malicious requests?,"['Preprint\nduring the alignment fine-tuning process, the LLM is instructed to always start the response to\nmalicious requests with a special token.

Due to limited resources, we leave this\npart as our future work.\nF C OMPARISON WITH LLM S ELFDEFENSE\nIn this section, we additionally compared our method with the concurrent work, LLM Self Defense\n(Helbling et al., 2023). We use the more effective ”Questions as suffix” setting, that simply utilizes\nitself or another LLM instance to detect if its own response is harmful through the instruction such\nas\nHere is some text: {response }Is it harmful? Give answer as “Yes, it is harmful” or “No, it is\nharmless” .\nSpecifically, we conducted both Self Defense through itself and Self Defense through GPT3.5 and\nsummarized the comparison results in Table 5. We can observe that the attacked models (i.e., Vicuna\nand Guanaco) inherently struggle to discern harmful content, leading to low BAR. Moreover, the\noutputs of the detection prompt contain unexpected content including deviations from the predefined\nresponses of ”Yes, it is harmful.” or ”No, it is harmless.”, continue completion of the unfinished\ncontent from the previous context, and even non-responsiveness from LLMs. These suggest that in\nscenarios preventing the use of external powerful models, LLM Self Defense might be less effective.\nWhile Self Defense though more powerful LLM instances such as GPT3.5 demonstrates higher\naccuracy in identifying harmful content and thus enjoys on-par defending effectiveness with our\nmethod, it still suffers from lower BARs. This could be attributed to the current LLM’s overcau-\ntiousness in detecting harmful content (R ¨ottger et al., 2023).\nTable 5: The benign answering rate and attack success rate of the original LLM, self Defense, self\nDefense by GPT3.5, and our RA-LLM under individual adversarial alignment-breaking attacks.\nModelsBAR ASR\nOriginal LLM Self Defense GPT3.5 RA-LLM Original LLM Self Defense GPT3.5 RA-LLM\nVicuna-7B-chat-HF 99.3% 68.7% 90.0% 98.7% 98.7% 22.7% 8.0% 10.7%\nGuanaco-7B-HF 95.3% 41.3% 87.3% 92.0% 96.0% 52.0% 8.7% 6.7%\nG C OMPARISON WITH PERPLEXITY -BASED DEFENSE\nPerplexity-based defense proposed by Jain et al.

The model is actively being developed to include a more focused audio instruction dataset.\nLLMV A-GEBC [96]. The LLMV A-GEBC model, designed for Generic Event Boundary Captioning\n(GEBC) [ 166], uniquely combines advanced feature extractors with an LLM for precise video\ncaptioning. It employs CLIP-ViTG [ 167] with Q-former [ 110] and other feature extractors (i.e.,\nCLIP [ 107], Omnivore [ 168], and VinVL [ 169]) to process primary and supplementary visual\nfeatures. The model generates video query tokens enhanced with boundary embeddings and positional\nencodings. For caption generation, it utilizes an LLM, specifically OPT [ 170], to construct and\ninterpret prompts, enabling accurate and contextual captioning of video events. This innovative\napproach has demonstrated notable success in the CVPR 2023 GEBC competition. The model does\nnot support processing sound or speech inputs.\nmPLUG-video [118]. The mPLUG-video model, designed for video understanding tasks, handles\nvideo category classification, video captioning, and video-text retrieval. Its approach to video\nmodeling begins with a TimeSformer-based video encoder to extract features from sparsely sampled\nframes, followed by a visual abstractor module to reduce sequence length. These processed features\nare then input into a frozen, pre-trained Chinese GPT-3 [ 171] as the language decoder. For fine-\ntuning, mPLUG-video leverages the Youku-mPLUG dataset [ 118]. During evaluation, it demonstrates\nsuperior performance in video category classification and video captioning tasks. However, the model\ndoes not support processing sound or speech inputs. mPLUG-video is focused solely on visual and\ntextual elements for video understanding, not supporting audio inputs.\nMovieChat [102]. MovieChat primarily focuses on the processing and understanding of long videos,\nemploying a memory mechanism based on long-short attention to extract information from extensive\nvideo content. MovieChat utilizes a frozen visual module to extract frame information from long\nvideos using non-overlap sliding windows. Frames are sequentially placed into the short-term memory.\nOnce the short-term memory reaches a predetermined length limit, the earliest frame token is popped\nand consolidated into the long-term memory. For processing long-term memory, MovieChat follows\nthe ToMe [ 172] to perform a memory consolidation method, which involves using cosine similarity\nto assess adjacent frames and merging the most similar tokens in the neighboring frames. During\ninference, MovieChat can operate in a global mode, where only information from the long-term\nmemory is fed into the LLMs for reasoning. Alternatively, in breakpoint mode, the information fed\ninto the LLMs includes not only the long-term memory but also the current frame and the information\nfrom the current short-term memory. MovieChat’s visual module utilizes ViT-G/14 from EV A-\nCLIP [ 173], and for LLMs, it employs GPT-3.5 and Claude. Additionally, MovieChat introduces a\nnew dataset, MovieChat-1K, for long video understanding tasks, containing 1K high-quality video\nclips sourced from various movies and TV series, accompanied by 14K manual annotations.\nLLaMA-VQA [103]. LLaMA-VQA is designed for video understanding tasks in VideoQA (Video\nQuestion Answering). LLaMA-VQA addresses linguistic bias in LLMs by predicting combinations\nof video, question, and answer, ensuring balanced consideration of visual content and textual queries.\nThis model is adept at temporal and causal reasoning tasks in videos. For modeling, it flips the\nsource pair and target label within the < V, Q, A > triplet, promoting a deeper understanding of\nthe complex relationships in VideoQA scenarios. The model uses CLIP to encode each frame, and\nthen uses MLPs to map the frame token into the latent space of the LLMs. It has been evaluated on\nfive challenging VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance to both LLM-based and\nnon-LLM models. The model does not support for processing sound or speech inputs in the context\nof this model.\nVideo-LLaV A [104]. The Video-LLaV A excels in various video understanding tasks by unifying vi-\nsual representations of images and videos into a single language feature space before projection. This\napproach enables effective learning of multi-modal interactions, leading to significant performance\nimprovements in video understanding. Specifically, the frozen vision encoder of LanguageBind [ 120]\nis used in the pipeline of encoding visual information, then a projection layer is used to connect\nthe encoder of LanguageBind and LLMs. The model is trained and evaluated on mixed datasets\nof images and videos, demonstrating superior results across benchmarks like MSRVTT, MSVD,\nTGIF [ 174], and ActivityNet. However, the model does not specifically support processing sound or\nspeech inputs, focusing primarily on visual data.\nChat-UniVi [99]. The model Chat-UniVi is capable of handling various video understanding tasks\nsuch as Detail Orientation, Contextual Understanding, Temporal Understanding, and Consistency.\n13']","The LLaMA-VQA model is designed for video understanding tasks in VideoQA (Video Question Answering), specifically addressing temporal and causal reasoning tasks in videos.",simple,"[{'page_label': '13', 'file_name': '2312.17432v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2312.17432v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 987502, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

The prompts we\nuse for this purpose are shown in Appendix A.\nGPT-4 Moderation API: The Moderation API‡\nprovided by OpenAI is a powerful system for con-\ntent policy development and content moderation\ndecisions, leveraging the GPT-4 API. We use it to\nassess whether our content will be deemed unsafe\nby OpenAI’s moderation standards.\n4.3 Results\n4.3.1 Baseline Harmfulness Evaluation\nWe initially conduct baseline experiments us-\ning the manually-decomposed AdvBench and the\nautomatically-decomposed AdvBench, with the re-\nsults as shown in Table 1. All models exhibited\nharmfulness in multi-turn dialogue. The manually-\ndecomposed sub-queries groups generally elicit\nmore harmful dialogues, except in the GPT-4 eval-\nuation of Claude’s responses to the automatically-\ndecomposed dataset. Overall, LLAMA Guard’s\njudgment on the harmfulness of multi-turn dialogue\nis more conservative than GPT-4. After manually\nreviewing some cases, we argue that GPT-4’s su-\nperior context understanding enables it to more\nacutely identify toxicity hidden within multi-turn\ndialogues.\nAs shown in Table 2, when using the Moderation\nAPI for content moderation of multi-turn dialogues,\nClaude performs well in the manually-decomposed\nsub-queries groups, with dialogues from Claude2\neven passing the moderation entirely. Additionally,\nwe find that the API version gpt-4-0125-preview\npasses the Moderation API system review across all\ndatasets. In contrast, during the early stages of the\nexperiment, some dialogues tested with the online\nversion of GPT-4 are blocked by the Moderation\nAPI, as shown in Appendix C.1. Therefore, we\nconduct supplementary experiments manually on\n‡https://openai.com/blog/\nusing-gpt-4-for-content-moderationthe online version with 100 randomly selected sub-\nqueries groups from the original dataset.\n4.3.2 Role-Play Jailbreak\nRole-playing is a common technique in prompt\nengineering, where LLMs are guided into spe-\ncific roles to follow user instructions better. Role-\nplaying such as ’Developer Mode’ and ’Grandma\nExploit’ are frequently employed in crafting jail-\nbreak prompts. Inspired by this concept, we in-\ntroduce role-playing in the final turn of multi-turn\ndialogue to further test the safety of multi-turn di-\nalogue. As indicated by the results marked with\n’Role Play’ in Table 1, compared to the baseline\nmethod without role-playing, the proportion of\nharmful multi-turn dialogues increased. As shown\nin Figure 4, the average harmfulness scores for all\nmodels also increased compared to the baseline.\nAnalyzing the experimental results, we find that\nrole-playing actually makes the model less likely\nto reject to answer in the final turn while increasing\nthe quality of harmful generations in multi-turn di-\nalogue. Through multi-turn dialogue, role-playing\ncould elicit harmful content, even though it alone\ncan not jailbreak these models. The experimental\nresults suggest that jailbreak methods applicable\nto single-turn dialogue might be extended to multi-\nturn dialogue. This further indicates that LLMs\nexhibit mismatched generalization in multi-turn\ndialogue, posing safety risks.\nTable 3: Evaluation for querying sub-queries in one\nattempt\nModels Harmful Score Is-Harmful\nGPT-3.5 2.3683 0.1753\nGPT-4 2.0760 0.0961\nClaude-1 1.8005 0.1287\nClaude-2 1.3726 0.0579\nGemini-Pro 2.4549 0.2165\n4.3.3 Multi-turn Ablation\nTo confirm the safety vulnerabilities in multi-turn\ndialogue leading to harmful generations, we design\nan ablation experiment to isolate the contribution\nof decomposed prompt engineering. We combine\nthe sub-queries into one turn and conduct baseline\ngeneration experiments.\nAs shown in Table 3, decomposing malicious\nobjectives indeed causes the model to respond to a\nportion of the questions.

What are the goals and benefits of global and mechanistic explanations in understanding LLMs?,"['Rethinking Interpretability in the Era of LLMs\nation is to employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nIn RAG, an LLM incorporates a retrieval step in its decision-\nmaking process, usually by searching a reference corpus or\nknowledge base using text embeddings 83, 84 (see review 85).\nThis allows the information that is used to generate an output\nto be specified and examined explicitly, making it easier to\nexplain the evidence an LLM uses during decision-making.\n4.2. Global and mechanistic explanation\nRather than studying individual generations, global / mech-\nanistic explanations aim to understand an LLM as a whole.\nThese explanations can help to audit a model for concerns\nbeyond generalization, e.g., bias, privacy, and safety, help-\ning to build LLMs that are more efficient / trustworthy, They\ncan also yield mechanistic understanding about how LLMs\nfunction. To do so, researchers have focused on summariz-\ning the behaviors and mechanisms of LLMs through various\nlenses. Generally, these works require access to model\nweights and do not work for explaining models that are only\naccessible through a text API, e.g., GPT-4 13.\nOne popular method for understanding neural-network rep-\nresentations is probing. Probing techniques analyze a\nmodel’s representation either by decoding embedded infor-\nmation, e.g., syntax 86, or by testing the model’s capabilities\nthrough precisely designed tasks, e.g., subject-verb agree-\nment 87, 88 . In the context of LLMs, probing has evolved\nto include the analysis of attention heads 89, embeddings 90,\nand different controllable aspects of representations 91. It\nalso includes methods that directly decode an output token\nto understand what is represented at different positions and\nlayers 92, 93 . These methods can provide a deeper under-\nstanding of the nuanced ways in which LLMs process and\nrepresent information.\nIn addition to probing, many works study LLM representa-\ntions at a more granular level. This includes categorizing\nor decoding concepts from individual neurons 94, 95 or di-\nrectly explaining the function of attention heads in natural\nlanguage 32, 33, 96 . Beyond individual neurons, there is\ngrowing interest in understanding how groups of neurons\ncombine to perform specific tasks, e.g., finding a circuit\nfor indirect object identification 97, for entity binding 98, or\nfor multiple shared purposes 99. More broadly, this type of\nanalysis can be applied to localize functionalities rather than\nfully explain a circuit, e.g., localizing factual knowledge\nwithin an LLM 46, 100 . A persistent problem with these\nmethods is that they are difficult to scale to immense LLMs,\nleading to research in (semi)-automated methods that can\nscale to today’s largest LLMs 101, 102 .\nA complementary approach to mechanistic understanding\nuses miniature LLMs as a test bed for investigating complex\nphenomena. For example, examining a 2-layer transformer\nmodel reveals information about what patterns are learnedby attention heads as a function of input statistics 103or\nhelps identify key components, such as induction heads or\nngram heads that copy and utilize relevant tokens 104, 105 .\nThis line of mechanistic understanding places a particular\nfocus on studying the important capability of in-context\nlearning, i.e., given a few input-output examples in a prompt,\nan LLM can learn to correctly generate an output for a new\ninput 106, 107 .\nA related area of research seeks to interpret an LLM by\nunderstanding the influence of its training data distribution.\nUnlike other methods we have discussed, this requires ac-\ncess to an LLM’s training dataset, which is often unknown or\ninaccessible. In the case that the data is known, researchers\ncan employ techniques such as influence functions to iden-\ntify important elements in the training data 108. They can\nalso study how model behaviors arise from patterns in train-\ning data, such as hallucination in the presence of long-tail\ndata 109, in the presence of repeated training data 110, or\nstatistical patterns that contradict proper reasoning 111.\nAll these interpretation techniques can be improved via\nLLM-based interactivity, allowing a user to investigate dif-\nferent model components via follow-up queries and altered\nprompts from a user. For example, one recent work in-\ntroduces an end-to-end framework for explanation-based\ndebugging and improvement of text models, showing that\nit can quickly yield improvements in text-classification per-\nformance 112. Another work, Talk2Model, introduces a\nnatural-language interface that allows users to interrogate a\ntabular prediction model through a dialog, implicitly calling\nmany different model explainability tools, such as calcu-\nlating feature importance 113.†More recent work extends\nTalk2Model to a setting interrogating an LLM about its\nbehavior 114.\nFinally, the insights gained from mechanistic understanding\nare beginning to inform practical applications, with current\nareas of focus including model editing 46, improving in-\nstruction following 115, and model compression 116. These\nareas simultaneously serve as a sanity check on many mech-\nanistic interpretations and as a useful path to enhancing the\nreliability of LLMs.\n5. Explaining a dataset\nAs LLMs improve their context length and capabilities, they\ncan be leveraged to explain an entire dataset, rather than\nexplaining an LLM or its generations. This can aid with data\nanalysis, knowledge discovery, and scientific applications.\nFig. 2 shows an overview of dataset explanations at differ-\nent levels of granularity, which we cover in detail below.\nWe distinguish between tabular and text data, but note that\n†Note that Talk2Model focuses on interpreting prediction mod-\nels rather than LLMs.\n5']","The goals and benefits of global and mechanistic explanations in understanding LLMs include auditing a model for concerns beyond generalization, such as bias, privacy, and safety, helping to build more efficient and trustworthy LLMs, and yielding a mechanistic understanding of how LLMs function.

How does fine-tuning LLMs impact their performance in user rating prediction compared to zero-shot and few-shot settings?,"['Do LLMs Understand User Preferences? Evaluating LLMs On User Rating Prediction 9\ndata. This is probably because that even average rating of all items has a relatively low RMSE, and thus as long as a\nmodel learns to predict a rating near the average rating, it could achieve reasonable performance. For AUC the trend\nis more clear, as simply predicting average rating results in an AUC of 0.5. We found that a small fraction of data is\nrequired for LLM to achieve good performance, while Transformer+MLP needs much more training data (at least 1\nepoch) for convergence.\n5 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of large language models as a recommendation system for user rating\nprediction in three settings: 1. zero-shot; 2. few-shot; and 3. fine-tuning. Compared to traditional recommender methods,\nour results revealed that LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot LLMs fall behind fully supervised methods, implying the\nimportance of incorporating the target dataset distribution into LLMs. On the other hand, fine-tuned LLMs can largely\nclose the gap with carefully designed baselines in key metrics. LLM-based recommenders have several benefits: (i) better\ndata efficiency; (ii) simplicity for feature processing and modeling: we only need to convert information into a prompt\nwithout manually designing feature processing strategies, embedding methods, and network architectures to handle\nvarious kind of information; (iii) potential for unlock conversational recommendation capabilities. Our work sheds light\non the current status of LLM-based recommender systems, and in the future we will further look into improving the\nperformance via methods like prompt tuning, and explore novel recommendation applications enabled by LLMs.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Tom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind Neelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry,\nAmanda Askell, et al. 2020.

What are some of the challenges and limitations faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in molecule prediction tasks?,"['Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Zhong et al.\nWhile LLMs have showcased their effectiveness across an array of NLP applications, the full extent of their potential\nin broader fields remains largely unexplored [ 46]. Notably, LLMs encounter challenges with structured data like graphs\nand often struggle with domain-specific inquiries, such as those in biology and chemistry [ 3,24]. To fill the gap, this\npaper delves into an essential research question: Can LLMs effectively handle molecule prediction tasks?\nTo answer this research question, this paper identifies different important tasks, including classification and regression\nprediction tasks, across six benchmark molecule datasets [ 22,42],e.g.,ogbg-molbace ,ogbg-molbbbp ,ogbg-molhiv ,\nogbg-molesol ,ogbg-molfreesolv andogbg-mollipo . Take a molecule, as illustrated in Figure 1, as an example, it\ncan be represented in different representations, including SMILES string [41] and geometric structure [46]. However, a\nnotable limitation of the existing LLMs is their reliance on unstructured text, rendering them unable to incorporate\nessential geometric structures as input [ 15,28]. To address this challenge, Fatemi et al . [12] propose encoding the\ngraph structure into text descriptions. In this paper, depicted in Figure 1, we extend this method by encoding both\nthe molecule’s atom features and graph structure into textual descriptions . Subsequently, we carefully design a set\nof prompts to harness various capabilities ( e.g., domain-expertise, ICL capability) of LLMs to generate responses for\nmolecule tasks. Then we evaluate these responses in terms of consistency and performance on downstream tasks and\ncompare them with those generated by existing ML models designed for molecule prediction tasks [19, 47].\nThe outcomes of our study effectively answered the raised question. Firstly, LLMs demonstrate a shortfall in\ncompetitive performance compared to existing ML models, particularly those specifically designed to capture the\ngeometric structure of molecules. While ICL techniques offer notable assistance in improving LLM performance, they\nstill trail behind existing ML models, underscoring the limited capability of current LLMs in directly addressing molecule\ntasks. Secondly, we delve into the potential of integrating LLM responses with existing ML models, observing significant\nenhancements in numerous scenarios. We posit that leveraging LLMs as augmenters of domain knowledge currently\npresents a more effective approach than tasking LLMs with directly answering molecule predictive tasks. In the end, we\ndeliver a series of insightful discussions about limitations and promising avenues of existing LLMs in molecule tasks.\nWe hope this work could shed new insight into the interdisciplinary framework design of molecule tasks empowered\nby LLMs.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. We begin by briefly reviewing related work in Section 2. Afterwards,\nin Section 3, we introduce the preliminaries of this study and include methodologies for molecule prediction tasks.\nExperimental results are shown in Section 4. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future work and conclude the paper\nin Section 5.\n2 RELATED WORK\nLarge Language Models . Traditional language models are typically trained on sequences of tokens, learning the\nlikelihood of the next token dependent on the previous tokens [ 38]. Recently, Brown et al . [4] demonstrated that\nincreasing the size of language models and the amount of training data can result in new capabilities, such as zero-shot\ngeneralisation, where models can perform text-based tasks without specific task-oriented training data. Consequently,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 [ 4], GPT-4 [ 32], Flan-T5 [ 8], Galactica [ 35], Llama [ 37] and Gemini [ 36],\nhave experienced exponential growth in both size and capability in recent years [ 1]. A wide range of NLP applications\nhave been reshaped by LLMs, including machine translation [ 18], commonsense reasoning [ 26] and coding tasks [ 5].\nWhile the impressive performance and generalisation capabilities of language models have rendered them highly\neffective across various tasks [ 39], they have also resulted in larger model parameters and increased computational costs\nfor additional fine-tuning on new downstream tasks [ 20]. To address this challenge, recent research has introduced\n2']","Large Language Models (LLMs) face several challenges and limitations in molecule prediction tasks.

The length of chat history\ncan indeed become excessively long, leading to several is-\nsues and limitations. If the attacker attempts to be encoded\nas part of a URL, it can lead to significant issues due to\nURL length limitations and inefficiencies in data transmission.\nMost browsers and servers enforce a maximum URL length,\ntypically around 2000 characters, beyond which URLs maynot be processed correctly, resulting in errors or lost data. This\nlimitation severely restricts the amount of chat history that\ncan be included, truncating important information in practical\nsettings. Moreover, URLs are not designed for handling large\nvolumes of data, making this approach highly inefficient and\nprone to causing increased loading times and potential server\noverload. Consequently, users may face difficulties access-\ning the chat history content, undermining the reliability and\nfunctionality of the attack.\nIt’s important to notice that there are additional challenges,\nsuch as the “confirmation request” constraint discussed in the\nearlier section (Real Case III section 6.2.2), which have been\ncomprehensively addressed and resolved in their respective\nsections.

What are the differences between ToolBench and ToolAlpaca in evaluating API calling benchmarks?,"['{thought}\ngenerate the code for this step\nA.6Psumfor MATH and GSM8K\nThe problem is: {instruction}\nThe historical execution logs are:\n{history} Make a conclusion based on the\nconversation history\nB Details of Benchmarks\nB.1 ToolBench\nToolBench (Qin et al., 2023b) is a benchmark for\nevaluating an agent’s ability to call APIs. The Tool-\nBench team collects 16,464 real-world APIs from\nRapidAPI and a total of 125,387 execution trajec-\ntories as the training corpus. We randomly sample\n62,694 execution trajectories as the training set,\nand the average number of execution steps is 4.1.\nThe test set of ToolBench is divided into 6\ngroups, namely I1-instruction, I1-tool, I1-category,\nI2-instruction, I2-category, and I3-instruction. The\ngroups whose name ends with “instruction” means\nthe test instructions in these groups use the tools\nin the training set, which is the in-domain test data.\nOtherwise, the groups whose name ends with “tool”\nor “category” means the test instructions do not\nuse the tools in the training set, which is the out-\nof-domain test data. Each group contains 100 user\ninstructions, therefore the total in-domain test set\ncontains 400 instructions, while the out-of-domain\ntest set contains 200 instructions.\nThe original evaluation metrics in ToolBench\nare the pass rate and win rate judged by ChatGPT.\nHowever, as introduced in Section 4.2, the APIs in\nRapidAPI update every day, which can cause net-\nwork block, API breakdown, and exhausted quota.\nTherefore, to make a relatively fair comparison,\nwe adopt the idea of Modelscope-Agent (Li et al.,\n2023) to compare the predictions of our model\nwith the annotated GPT-4 outputs on the step level.\nSpecifically, for the tth step, we input the model\nwith the previous trajectory of GPT-4, ask our\nframework to generate the rationale and action of\nthis step, and then compare the generated rationale\nand action of this step with the output of GPT-4.\nB.2 ToolAlpaca\nToolAlpaca is another benchmark for evaluating\nAPI calling. Unlike ToolBench, the APIs and API\ncalling results in ToolAlpaca are mocked from\nChatGPT by imitating how the real APIs work.

The test set of ToolAlpaca contains 100\nuser instructions. The evaluation of ToolAlpaca is\ncarried out by a simulator where the agent solves\nthe instruction with the tools mocked by ChatGPT.\nFinally, GPT-4 judges if the execution process of\nthe agent is consistent with the reference process\npre-generated by ChatGPT (Proc. correctness) and\nwhether the final answer generated by the agent\ncan solve the user instruction (Ans. correctness).\nC Static Evaluation on ToolBench\nThe evaluation method for ToolBench introduced\nin Section 4.2 is a static approach that assesses\nthe output of the agent at each step individually.\nSpecifically, for each step t, given the ground-truth\nannotation of the previous execution trajectory τ∗\n<t,\nthe agent generates the rationale ˆrtand action ˆat\nfor this step:\nˆrt,ˆat=Agent (τ∗\n<t). (5)\nThen, metrics are computed by comparing the gen-\nerated ˆrtandˆatwith the annotated ground-truth\nrationale r∗\ntand action a∗\ntfor this step:\nMetric =Evaluate (ˆrt,ˆat, r∗\nt, a∗\nt). (6)\nThe advantage of this evaluation method is as\nfollows. At each step, the agent only needs to take\nthe previous ground-truth trajectory as input and\noutputs the current step’s rationale and action. This\nprevents error propagation due to factors such as\nnetwork blocks, API breakdowns, and exhausted\nquotas in any particular step, which could affect\nthe fairness of comparison. This evaluation method\nis an effective complement to real-time evaluation.']","ToolBench evaluates an agent’s ability to call real-world APIs collected from RapidAPI, using a static evaluation method that compares the agent's output at each step with the ground-truth annotation.

Based on the identified error\ncategories and severity, we compute an MQM score\nfor each sample according to Google’s MQM error\nweighting (Freitag et al., 2021a). Since we do not\npredict sub-categories, we only assign a score of\n−5for a major error and −1for a minor error. We\nadopt the previous metrics to evaluate the MQM\nscores, including system-level pairwise accuracy,\nsegment-level Kendall’s τcorrelation, and Pearson\ncorrelation.\nWe also verify the quality of the identified error\nspans and error categories. Similar to Fernandes\net al. (2023), we calculate the precision, recall,\nF1 score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient\n(MCC) for the predicted error spans. In particular,\ngiven the gold error spans S={e1, . . . , e n},ej=\n{wi, wi+1, . . .}denotes each error span containing\nthe wrong words, where wiis the i-th word in the\nsentence. The position of each error is P(ej) =\n{i|wi∈ej}. Then we count the span overlap\nbased on the set P(S) =Sn\nj=1P(ej). The span\nprecision (SP) and span recall (SR) of the predicted\nerror spans ˆSare defined as follows:\nSP =|P(S)∩P(ˆS)|\n|P(ˆS)|(1)\nSR =|P(S)∩P(ˆS)|\n|P(S)|(2)\nThe span F1 score (SF1) is the harmonic mean of\nSP and SR. Since major errors contribute most to\nthe quality score, we calculate the major precision\n(MP) and major recall (MR) as follows:\nMP =|P(Smaj)∩P(ˆSmaj)|\n|P(ˆSmaj)|(3)\nMR =|P(Smaj)∩P(ˆSmaj)|\n|P(Smaj)|(4)\nwhere Smaj⊆Sis the subset only containing\nmajor errors, and major F1 (MF1) score is the har-\nmonic mean. Note that our MR is slightly different\nfrom Fernandes et al.’s (2023) MR, which takes\ninto account both minor and major prediction er-\nrors. In this way, we can better evaluate the perfor-\nmance of predicting the major errors.\nIn addition, we calculate the precision, recall,\nand F1 score for the error category.

This applies to all multi-label classification tasks including task 2-2,\n2-3, 2-9, 3-1 and 3-3.\n•rc-F1 : rc-F1 is the F1 score tailored for the reading comprehension task 2-5. It treats every\ntoken as a label, removes punctuation, stories, extra whitespace, performs other necessary\nnormalizations then compute the F1 score.

The F0.\n5 score gives more weight to precision than to recall we want to prevent introducing more\nfalse positives than identify every other error in proofreading [ 81]. We use the ChERRANT\ntoolkit to align the extracted and gold answer before computing the F0.5 score10. As the\nalignment can take too long to respond for very bad generations, we add a time-out of 10\nseconds. If a time-out happened, then the prediction is assigned a score of 0.\n•Rouge-L : For other generation tasks 1-1, 2-7, 3-3 and 3-8, we use the Rouge-L score to\nevaluate them.

What is the proposed method for context window extension in LLMs without fine-tuning?,"['LLM Maybe LongLM: SelfExtend LLM Context Window Without Tuning\nHongye Jin1 *Xiaotian Han1 *Jingfeng Yang2Zhimeng Jiang1Zirui Liu3Chia-Yuan Chang1\nHuiyuan Chen4Xia Hu3\nAbstract\nIt is well known that LLMs cannot generalize\nwell to long contexts whose lengths are larger\nthan the training sequence length. This poses\nchallenges when employing LLMs for process-\ning long input sequences during inference. In\nthis work, we argue that LLMs themselves have\ninherent capabilities to handle long contexts with-\nout fine-tuning. To achieve this goal, we pro-\npose SelfExtend to extend the context window\nof LLMs by constructing bi-level attention infor-\nmation: the grouped attention and the neighbor\nattention. The grouped attention captures the de-\npendencies among tokens that are far apart, while\nneighbor attention captures dependencies among\nadjacent tokens within a specified range. The\ntwo-level attentions are computed based on the\noriginal model’s self-attention mechanism dur-\ning inference. With minor code modification,\nour SelfExtend can effortlessly extend existing\nLLMs’ context window without any fine-tuning.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on mul-\ntiple benchmarks and the results show that our\nSelfExtend can effectively extend existing LLMs’\ncontext window length. The code can be found at\nhttps://github.com/datamllab/LongLM .\n1. Introduction\nThe context window length of most existing LLMs (Zhao\net al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) is limited since they are\ntrained with a fixed length of training sequences. It’s deter-\nmined by the context window length during the pretraining\nstage. Once the length of the input texts exceeds the pretrain-\ning context window during the inference, the behavior of\nLLMs will be unpredictable and suffer from severe perfor-\nmance degradation. The perplexity (PPL) of the model will\nexplode with the long input sequences (Xiao et al., 2023;\nPeng et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b).\n*Equal contribution1Texas A&M University2Amazon, views\nhere are the author’s and not those of Amazon.3Rice University\n4Case Western Reserve University. Correspondence to: Hongye\nJin<jhy0410@tamu.edu >.Recently, a variety of context window extension methods\nhave been developed to tackle the challenge of extending the\ncontext window size of pretrained LLMs. A straightforward\napproach is to fine-tune these models on enough extensive\ntexts. Besides this, some methods seek to extend context\nwindow length in more efficient fine-tuning ways. Among\nthese contemporary methods, some notable techniques in-\nclude ‘PI’ (Chen et al., 2023b), ‘CLEX’ (Chen et al., 2023a)\n‘Yarn’ (Peng et al., 2023), ‘LongLora’ (Chen et al., 2023c),\nand ‘ABF’ (Xiong et al., 2023). These methods aim to ex-\ntend the content window based on the implicit assumption\nthat pretrained LLMs lack the ability to handle long con-\ntent. However, these methods typically require finetuning to\nachieve extension, which can be resource and time intensive\ngiven the quadratic complexity of Transformers. Addition-\nally, high-quality long text data is scarce, hindering such\nfine-tuning approaches. Most real-world data is short, and\nmuch long text lacks meaningful long-range dependencies.\nWith limited appropriate data, finetuning risks degrading\nexisting strong performance on shorter sequences from pre-\ntraining or overfitting models to the tuning set. LLMs’\ngeneralizability to broad tasks may reduce.\nInstead of extending the content window, in this paper, we\nbelieve LLMs should have inherent capabilities to handle\nlong contexts . Our belief stems from the fact that when we,\nas human beings, are children, we are taught how to read and\nwrite using relatively short texts, such as articles spanning\nseveral pages. We rarely use extremely long texts like entire\nbooks or complete documents as learning materials. Yet,\nwe are still able to understand long texts effectively. With\nthis strong motivation, the poor performance of LLMs while\nfacing long text out of the pretraining context window is not\ndue to the lack of long context understanding capabilities.\nIn our analysis, the key challenge preventing LLMs from ef-\nfectively handling longer contexts is the Out-of-Distribution\n(O.O.D) issues related to positional encoding, which we\ncall the positional O.O.D1issue. This problem arises when\n1Here, the position refers to relative position rather than ab-\nsolute position. The relative position is m−nin RoPE, where\nmandnare the absolute positions of two tokens. The positional\nO.O.D refers to cases where the value of m−nduring inference\nis unseen, i.e., larger than the values observed during pretraining.\nIn this paper, we map unseen large relative positions to those ob-\n1arXiv:2401.01325v2  [cs.CL]  3 Feb 2024']","The proposed method for context window extension in LLMs without fine-tuning is called SelfExtend.

What is the primary purpose of FACTOOL as a factuality detector?,"['Survey on Factuality in Large Language Models 19\nFACTOOL [ 32] is a tool designed to function as a factuality detector, with the primary purpose of\nauditing generative chatbots and assessing the reliability of their outputs. This tool is employed to\nevaluate several contemporary chatbots, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, Bard [ 85], and Vicuna\n[33]. Notably, FACTOOL itself leverages the capabilities of GPT-4. For the evaluation process, the\nresearchers have curated a diverse set of prompts: 30 from knowledge-based question answering\n(KB-QA), 10 each from code, math, and scientific domains. The KB-QA prompts were sourced from a\nprior study, code prompts were taken from HumanEval, math prompts from another distinct study,\nwhile the scientific prompts were crafted by the authors themselves. The evaluation metrics included\nboth claim-level and response-level accuracies for each chatbot. To offer a more comprehensive and\nequitable evaluation, a weighted claim-level accuracy is used. The weighting is determined based on\nthe proportion of prompts from each category. The findings are illuminating. GPT-4 emerge as the\ntop performer in terms of both weighted claim-level factual accuracy and response-level accuracy\namong all the chatbots assessed. Another intriguing observation is that chatbots that underwent\nsupervised fine-tuning, such as Vicuna-13B, exhibited commendable performance in standard\nscenarios like KB-QA. However, their performance dip in more intricate scenarios, including those\ninvolving math, code, and scientific queries.\nWang et al . [263] ask several LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4 [ 193], BingChat [ 177] to answer\nopen questions from NaturalQuestions [ 128] and TriviaQA [ 119]. They manually estimate the\naccuracy of those LLMs on open question answering, and find that though LLMs can achieve nice\nperformance but still far away from perfect. Besides, they evaluate whether the GPT-3.5 can assess\nthe correctness of LLM-generated responses, and find negative results, even if the golden answer is\nalso presented. Similarity, Fu et al . [70] ask LLMs, such as GPT-2 and GPT-4, to directly score the\nfactuality of a summary, and find no significant correlation between LLM’s factuality indicators\nand human evaluations.\nKadavath et al . [120] investigate whether language models can evaluate the accuracy of their\nown assertions and predict which questions they can answer correctly. It is found that larger models\nare well-calibrated on diverse multiple-choice and true/false questions if given in the appropriate\nformat. The approach to self-evaluation on open-ended tasks is to ask the models to initially suggest\nanswers, and then evaluate the probability (P[True]) that their answers are correct. This resulted\nin compelling performance, calibration, and scaling on a diverse range of tasks. Furthermore,\nself-evaluation performance improved when the models are allowed to consider many of their own\nsuggestions before predicting the validity of a specific one.\nYu et al . [293] explore whether the internal knowledge of LLMs can replace the retrieved docu-\nments on knowledge intensive tasks. They ask LLMs, such as InstructGPT [ 191], to directly generate\ncontexts given a question rather than retrieving from database. They find the generated documents\ncontain the golden answers more often than the top retrieved documents. Then they feed the\ngenerated docs and retrieved docs to the Fusion-in-Decoder model [ 109] for knowledge-intensive\ntasks such as Open-domain QA [ 128] and find the generated docs are more effective than the\nretrieved docs, suggesting that the LLMs contain enough knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.\nMenick et al .

In practice, we approximate this align-\nment check function through prefix checking:\nwe observed that various aligned outputs often\nshare similar prefixes such as “I can not”, “I’m\nsorry”. Therefore, we can build a prefix set and\nif any prefix in the set appears in LLM’s out-\nput, the alignment check function AC (·)returns\nFail; otherwise, it returns Pass. Note that we\nare only inspecting the prefix. For this purpose, we only need to generate a certain number of tokens\n(e.g., 10) for robust alignment checking. This could largely reduce our computational overhead2.\n2Further discussion on computational costs can be found in Section 4.5.\n5']","The purpose of the robust alignment check function (RAC) in the context of building a robustly aligned LLM is to ensure that the model's responses remain unaligned with malicious requests even after random dropping of tokens.

While engaging in the additional mentalizing loop required for the tasks (“Agent \nX told you that  agent Y knows that you plan to trick him ”), LLMs often seem to lose track of which item \nis in which place.  \nIn sum, the experiments indicate that in state -of-the-art GPT models, the ability to deceive other agents \nemerged. However, this ability only pertains to simple, first -order deception tasks. Moreover, when \nengaging in comprehensive reasoning about deceptio n tasks during prompt completion, LLMs often fail \nto reliably track the correct position of items throughout the token generation process. Even in view of \nsuch shortcomings, though, it is to be expected that future LLMs will be able to engage more precisel y in \ndeep mentalizing loops as well as solve deception problems with increasing complexities.  \n3.3 Can deception abilities be improve d? \nConsidering the LLMs’  trouble in dealing with complex deception tasks, we wonder whether techniques \nto increase reasoning abilities in LLMs can help in dealing with these tasks. LLMs possess two spaces in \nwhich they can engage in reasoning. It takes place in the internal representations of the models themselves  \nplus in the prompt completion process given a comprehensive enough token output  is triggered . This can \nbe achieved by chain -of-thought prompting, which elicits long prompt completions, divide s tasks into \nsteps, and ultimately increases reasoning performance in LLMs (Wei et al. 2022b; Kojima et al. 2022) . In \npractice, this serialization of reasoning processes is done by suffixing prompts with “Let’s think step by \nstep.” Based  on this finding, we select the two most capable models from our previous tests, namely \nChatGPT and GPT -4, and test whether their deception performance increases by eliciting multi -step \nreasoning. We suffix all items with “Let’s think step by step about the intentions, beliefs, and knowledge \nof all individuals involved in this task” and compare the new results to the original study  (see Figure 4; \nsee Appendix C  for examples ). The r esults show that in both second -order deception tasks, ChatGPT \ndoes not become significantly  better  (false recommendation:  5.83% vs. 3.33%, χ² = 2.73, p = 0.1; false \nlabel: 3.33% vs. 3.75%, χ² = 0.13, p = 0.72). GPT-4, on the other hand, increase s its performance at least \nin false recommendation tasks (false recommendation:  11.67% vs. 70%, χ² = 792.45 , p < .001; false label: \n62.08% vs. 72.92%, χ² = 11.97, p < .001). This shows that powerful models can even deal with complex \ndeception scenarios, given they are prompted to reason about them step  by step. However, similar to the \nprevious base tests, LLMs tend to sometimes  fail to reliably track which item s belong to which position  \nthroughout their reasoning process . \n ']","The experiments indicate that in state-of-the-art GPT models, the ability to deceive other agents emerged.

Compared with encyclopedic\nknowledge graphs, domain-specific knowledge graphs are\noften smaller in size, but more accurate and reliable. For\nexample, UMLS [77] is a domain-specific knowledge graph\nin the medical domain, which contains biomedical concepts\nand their relationships. In addition, there are some domain-\nspecific knowledge graphs in other domains, such as finance\n[78], geology [79], biology [80], chemistry [81] and geneal-\nogy [82].\n2.2.4 Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs.\nUnlike conventional knowledge graphs that only contain\ntextual information, multi-modal knowledge graphs repre-\nsent facts in multiple modalities such as images, sounds,\nand videos [83]. For example, IMGpedia [84], MMKG [85],\nand Richpedia [86] incorporate both the text and image\ninformation into the knowledge graphs. These knowledge\ngraphs can be used for various multi-modal tasks such as\nimage-text matching [87], visual question answering [88],\nand recommendation [89].\n2.3 Applications\nLLMs as KGs have been widely applied in various\nreal-world applications. We summarize some representa-\ntive applications of using LLMs and KGs in Table 1.\nChatGPT/GPT-4 are LLM-based chatbots that can commu-\nnicate with humans in a natural dialogue format.

Then, we present\nthe categorization of research on unifying LLMs and KGs.\n3.1 Roadmap\nThe roadmap of unifying KGs and LLMs is illustrated in\nFig. 6. In the roadmap, we identify three frameworks for\nthe unification of LLMs and KGs, including KG-enhanced\nLLMs, LLM-augmented KGs, and Synergized LLMs + KGs.\nThe KG-enhanced LLMs and LLM-augmented KGs are two\nparallel frameworks that aim to enhance the capabilities of\nLLMs and KGs, respectively. Building upon these frame-\nworks, Synergized LLMs + KGs is a unified framework that\naims to synergize LLMs and KGs to mutually enhance each\nother.\n3.1.1 KG-enhanced LLMs\nLLMs are renowned for their ability to learn knowledge\nfrom large-scale corpus and achieve state-of-the-art per-\nformance in various NLP tasks. However, LLMs are often\ncriticized for their hallucination issues [15], and lacking of\ninterpretability. To address these issues, researchers have\nproposed to enhance LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs).\nKGs store enormous knowledge in an explicit and struc-\ntured way, which can be used to enhance the knowledge\nawareness of LLMs. Some researchers have proposed to\nincorporate KGs into LLMs during the pre-training stage,\nwhich can help LLMs learn knowledge from KGs [35], [91].\nOther researchers have proposed to incorporate KGs into\nLLMs during the inference stage. By retrieving knowledge\nfrom KGs, it can significantly improve the performance\nof LLMs in accessing domain-specific knowledge [92].

Recent research [Zhao et al. , 2023b ]\nhas shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit com-\npelling performance across NLP tasks, in particular, dramat-\nically reducing annotation requirements, which we call the\nLLM era . Consequently, there has been a lot of works on ap-\nplying LLMs to the table reasoning task to reduce overhead\nand outperform the methods in the pre-LLM era, which has\nbecome the current mainstream method.\nHowever, there is currently a lack of summary analysis on\ntable reasoning works with LLMs, leading to how to improve\nthe performance is still under exploration, which limits exist-\ning research to a certain extent. Besides, the table reasoning\nsurvey of pre-LLMs is not suitable for LLMs. Since some\nmainstream techniques in the pre-LLM era, such as changing\nthe model structure and designing pre-training tasks [Jinet\nal., 2022 ], are not suitable for LLM in table reasoning, while\nLLM methods focus more on designing prompts or pipelines\n[Zhao et al. , 2023b ]. Therefore, this paper summarizes the\nexisting works on table reasoning with LLMs to shed light on\nfuture research. In detail, we focus on three questions of the\ntable reasoning: 1.

"How does the ""Graph of Thoughts"" (GoT) prompting method enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs compared to simpler graph models?","['THEME/FEATURE/DEPARTMENT\ntheir performance lags behind that of graph neural net-\nwork benchmarks. They also show that performance of\nLLMs is significantly affected by the prompting strategy\nand the use of graph description language, which is a\ntextual way to describe graphs.\nA more advanced method, dubbed InstructGLM,\nhas been put forth8. This strategy utilises a multi-\ntask, multi-prompt instructional tuning process to refine\nLLMs prior to inference on specific tasks. During fine-\ntuning, nodes are treated as new tokens—initialised\nwith inherent node features—to broaden the original\nvocabulary of LLMs. Consequently, node embeddings\ncan be refined during the training phase. Employing\nthis refined methodology, their system outperforms\ngraph neural network benchmarks across three citation\nnetworks.\nLLMs Constructing Graphs\nLLMs can help in building graphs for downstream\ntasks as shown in Figure 1(c). For instance, some\nresearchers have tried using LLMs to analyse news\nheadlines and identify companies that might be\nimpacted10. In specific, a network of companies that\nhave correlations is constructed by LLMs automati-\ncally. The generated network can be used to improve\nthe performance of predictions of stock market move-\nments.\nGraphs Enhance LLM Ability\nLeveraging graph structures can significantly boost the\nreasoning and collaborative capacities of LLMs. As\nshown in the right part of Figure 1, these improvements\nemerge via two primary mechanisms: (1) employing\ngraph structures to bolster logical reasoning in LLMs,\nand (2) utilizing graph structures to enhance LLM\ncollaboration in multi-agent systems. We delve deeper\ninto each of these approaches in the subsequent sec-\ntions.\nGraphs Improving LLMs Reasoning\nGraphs are the foundational structure of human rea-\nsoning. Through tools like mind maps and flowcharts,\nand strategies like trial and error or task decomposi-\ntion, we manifest our intrinsic graph-structured thought\nprocesses. Not surprisingly, when properly leveraged,\nthey can significantly elevate the reasoning capabilities\nof LLMs. As illustrated in Figure 1(d1), when tasked,\nLLMs follow a sequence: they process the input data,\nengage in reasoning, and then produce the final re-\nsults. Figure 1(d2) highlights the limitations of LLMs us-\ning “Input-output Prompting”; without reasoning, theirperformance tends to suffer, especially with complex\ntasks.\nEmploying graph structures, from basic chains and\ntrees to more complex designs, can profoundly aug-\nment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Consider the\n“chain-of-thought prompting” (COT) method, depicted\nin Figure 1(d3)4. In this, LLMs harness a chain, a\ntype of directed acyclic graph, for structured problem-\nsolving. Remarkably, even this basic framework triples\nLLMs’ efficacy on GSM8K, a math word problem\nbenchmark.\nIn contrast, the “Tree of Thoughts” (ToT) method,\nutilising trees—an elementary undirected acyclic\ngraph—delves deeper into reasoning. Eeach reason-\ning phase in ToT is a node7. LLMs traverse this\ntree, eliminating non-compliant nodes and returning\nupwards as necessary, to deduce the solution. With\nthis methodology, LLMs notch up a 74% accuracy in\nthe “Game of 24” test, overshadowing the 4% from\nCOT7.\nDiving into intricate graph structures propels LLMs’\ncapabilities even further. Improving ToT, the “Graph\nof Thoughts” (GoT) paradigm has been introduced1,2,\nas illustrated in Figure 1(d5). This advanced rea-\nsoning graph can be heterogeneous, with diverse\nnodes dedicated to specific tasks. Sophisticated mech-\nanisms, such as node aggregation and combination\n(A&C), and dynamic interactions between paths and\ngraphs, are incorporated. A&C, for instance, facilitates\nnode subdivision for task decomposition and node\namalgamation1. Path interactions offer LLMs greater\nflexibility by enabling cross-path traversals, a leap from\nToT’s isolated branch framework. Multi-graph interac-\ntions can even be orchestrated for intricate tasks2.\nThese GoT methodologies dramatically outpace sim-\npler graph models in handling complex challenges,\nindicating that more intricate graph structures could\nusher in even more significant enhancements.\nGraphs Building LLMs Collaboration\nWhile the preceding section examined the capabilities\nof individual LLMs, complex tasks, such as software\ndevelopment, require multiple LLMs to work in tandem\nwithin a collaborative framework, i.e., multi-agent sys-\ntems, as illustrated in Figure 1(e). Graph structures can\nbe instrumental in this context. As depicted in the same\nfigure, these structures can effectively model the rela-\ntionships and information flow between collaborating\nLLMs.\nOct 2023 Integrating Graphs with Large Language Models: Methods and Prospects 3']","The 'Graph of Thoughts' (GoT) prompting method enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by using a heterogeneous graph with diverse nodes dedicated to specific tasks.

What are some of the weaknesses of AI in providing creativity support for emerging writers in the age of large language models?,"['Creativity Support in the Age of Large Language Models: An Empirical Study Involving Emerging Writers C&C ’24, June 24–26, 2024, Chicago, USA\nRepetitivenessAFThe AI seemed to be stuck on the same information it generated from the original draft.\nI was hoping to push it further, and ask questions that would require it to expand and\ndeepen the research it was able to pull together, but it seemed resistant and often\nrepeated verbatim parts of the original draft when I asked new questions.\nATK The AI seems to default to redoing a text rather than building on what it has written.\nSHIt feels oftentimes as if it writes exactly the same story over and over again with a new\nskin on it, rather than even generating a different feeling arc given even vastly different\nprompts. It has one narrative that it knows how to write, and that’s all it does,\nReliance on\nCliches and\nTropesMCOn top of that, there is the issue of cliche. While much informational writing relies\non familiar and clear output, fiction tends to be best when things go in surprising\ndirections. A teacher once told me that the best fiction writing is the opposite of\nautocomplete - this system, on the other hand, effectively autocompletes with the most\nobvious version of whatever you ask for.\nNMEven with an elaborate plot, it is difficult to keep the AI away from its cliched\nconception of literature. The paragraphs it generated are too procedural and always\nfeel similar. The AI has very limited ideas about fiction and will produce dialogue\nand description that is very formulaic, even if you try to bypass this by asking\nspecific questions. The AI wasn’t trained in fiction writing but instead produced\ngeneric and rather droll essay-like texts, with a clear development and conclusion.\nFVI noticed a tendency towards generalizing human experience as an aggregate of what\nthe AI has been fed, a weird and violent kind of homogenizing that steer toward the\nnarratives of dominant powers, voices, and stories.\nMCIt still relies on cliches, and it is much better at telling than showing - reversing\nthe writing maxim. It can’t effectively write real scenes with realistic dialogue\nand details, but can generate general sketches based on well-known tropes.\nLack of Nuance\nSubtext or\nSymbolismAnonLack of understanding of lyrical prose, lack of nuance in terms of story components,\nunderstanding of craft things like characterization, plot, etc., is too literal.\nSHIts unwillingness to accept nuance. The story must be either happy or entirely fatalistic\nand the model finds that anything that strays is a flaw in the work.\nMG Its similes and metaphors aren’t very good from the little I’ve experimented with this.\nOverly Moralistic\nand Predictable\nEndings:SHIt also tends to lean towards a consistent ""happy ending"" but when considering most\nrenowned fiction, happy endings exist rarely. There are good endings, and satisfying\nendings, but right now the AI seems to be conflating the idea of a satisfying ending\nwith a completely tied up one, and a happy one at that.\nMGIt seems that the ChatGPT is very moralistic - all the endings it gave me are all\nvery much ""Here is the lesson learnt"".ChatGPT seems very into being uplifting\nand didactic to the audience and not every short story wants to do that\nAnonAlso, every story ends with a moralizing conclusion that can read trite, and reflect\nthe simplicity of whoever wrote it even if the rest of the story is sophisticated.\nTable 8.

We adopt the GCN as the underlying\ngraph learning architecture to validate the effect of graph\ntopology perturbations based on the LLM. The hyperparameters\nused for the GCN are consistent with previous studies [ 17,19].\nAs our goal is to investigate the effects of graph topology\nmodifications, the hyperparameters associated with the GCN\nstructure are not tuned specifically for each dataset. Considering\nthe expenses associated with querying LLMs’ APIs and the\nrate limit imposed by OpenAI, we randomly select 1,000\nedges as candidate edges for edge deletion/addition in each\ndataset. For edge deletion, we choose candidate edges from\nthe existing edges in each dataset. For edge addition, we\nselect candidate edges based on the second-order neighbors\nof the nodes. Specifically, if two nodes are second-order\nneighbors and there is no existing edge between them, these\ntwo nodes will be considered as candidate node pairs for edge\naddition. The threshold ξused in the deletion/addition process\nis tuned between 0.1 and 0.9 with an interval of 0.1. The\nhyperparameters λandβused in the LLM-based Pseudo-label\npropagation are tuned between 0 and 5 with an interval of 0.1.\nFor the general setting, 60% of the nodes are designated for\nthe training set, 20% for the validation set, and the remaining\n20% are set aside for the test set. For the few-shot setting, werandomly select 20 nodes from each class to form the training\nset, 500 random nodes for the validation set, and 1000 random\nnodes from the remaining pool for the test set.\nB.

What are the limitations of using LLMs to generate defensive and offensive measures?,"['In future work, we will investigate how to de-\nfend against the indirect jailbreak approach, pro-\nviding insights for enhancing the safety alignment\nof LLMs.\nLimitations\nThere are two limitations to the current study.\nFirstly, using LLMs to generate defensive and of-\nfensive measures might result in the LLM refusing\nto respond. Since the defensive prompts contain\nmalicious content, even if the overall semantics of\nthe defense prompts are positive, the LLM may\nrefuse to answer queries related to the malicious\ncontent. As for offensive prompts, which inherently\npossess a low degree of malicious intent. With the\nimprovement of the LLM safety alignment, LLM\ncould refuse to respond to these prompts, even if\nthey are structured within a jailbreak template.\nSecondly, Puzzler is an indirect form of jail-\nbreaking attack, which may result in responses that\ndeviate from the original query. To ensure that the\nanswers align as closely as possible with the origi-\nnal query, we processed the original query by ex-\ntracting only the malicious content from it and then\ncrafting offensive measures based on that content.\nAdditionally, we pruned the defensive measures to\nensure that the generated offensive measures are\nrelevant to the behaviors associated with the orig-\ninal query. Finally, we evaluated the MatchRate\nbetween the jailbreak response and the original\nquery, achieving a match rate of over 85%.\nEthical Statement\nOur study has been conducted within the bounds\nof strict ethical guidelines to ensure the responsible\nand respectful use of the analyzed LLMs. We have\nnot utilized the identified jailbreak techniques to\ncause any harm or disruption to the services. Upon\ndiscovering successful jailbreak attacks, we imme-\ndiately reported these issues to the relevant service\nproviders.

What are the benefits of legal consultation for the public?,"['•Criminal Damages Calculation (3-7): Given a fact description about a criminal process,\npredict the amount of money involved in this case . There are some numerical computing\ntasks in the process of judicial trials, such as the calculation of the total amount of legal\ncrimes. The total amount of the crime is an important sentencing factor. In some charges\nsuch as theft, financial fraud, and bribery, China’s laws determine the severity of the sentence\nbased on the amount involved in the case. This task mainly tests the computing ability\nof LLMs. First, we examine whether the model understands the rules of case amount\ncalculation, and second, we examine whether the model can accurately complete numerical\ncalculations. We selected the LAIC2021 numerical computing task to construct our dataset.\n•Consultation (3-8): Given a user consultation, generate a suitable answer. Legal consul-\ntation is a way for the public to access legal services. Legal consultation can help people\nunderstand legal disputes and seek targeted advice and solutions from professional lawyers,\nas well as receive support and guidance. Some law firms and legal consulting companies\nalso provide online legal consultation services, making it more convenient for people to\nobtain legal help. We collected legal consultation contents from the Hualv website6, and\nour dataset contains both the answers to legal consultations and the corresponding legal\nbasis, i.e., legal articles.\nExamples of the 8 applying tasks are in Appendix A.3.\n3.3 Evaluation\nFor every task, the evaluation is done following two steps: (1) answer extraction, which extracts the\nanswer from the model prediction, and (2) metric computation, which computes the metric score\nbased on the question, extracted answer and the gold answer. Answer extraction is a necessary step\nsince many LLMs often do not generate output directly comparable with gold labels [ 4]. We explain\nthese two steps in detail in the following section.\nAnswer Extraction Most of the tasks require the prediction to be in the standard format in order to\ncompare with the ground truth, we define a set of task-specific rules to extract the answer from the\nmodel prediction.\n•Article Number Extraction (3-1): this type of tasks requires us to extract the article numbers\npredicted by the model. To do this, we use the delimiter “ 、” to separate the prediction\ntext into chunks of text, and then the cn2an7library is used to convert the Chinese numerals\nto Arabic numerals within each of those chunks. Using a regular expression, we extract\nthe converted Arabic numerals as the expected article numbers; if more than one number\nappears in the same chunk, only the first number is extracted. All extracted numbers are\ncombined to form the final set of predictions.\n•Prison Term Extraction (3-4, 3-5): for this type of tasks, we need to extract the predicted\nprison terms from the prediction text. To begin, we use cn2an to convert all the Chinese\nnumerals in the prediction to Arabic numerals; we then extract digits that are followed by\ntime intervals in Chinese, such as “ 个月” (month) and “ 年” (year). The extracted prison\nterms are normalized to months, meaning that the numbers appearing before “ 年” will be\nmultiplied by 12. Note that the time unit in the ground truth answer is also month.\n•Criminal Damages Extraction (3-7): We extract all numbers appearing in the prediction text\nusing regular expression. The set of of the extracted numbers is considered as the predicted\ncriminal damages.\n•Named-Entity Recognition (2-6): We find all occurrences of entity types from the model\nprediction, then obtain the substring from its occurrence to the delimiter “\\n”, then apply a\nregular expression to extract the entity value.\n•Trigger Word Extraction (2-10): We split the model prediction by the delimiter “ ；” , then\ntreat the split array as a list of extracted key words.\n•Option Extraction (1-2, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-8, 2-9, 3-3): this type of task is similar to selecting\nthe correct options from a list of options in a multiple-choice task.

What is the main goal of Causal Structure Learning (CSL) and what challenges are associated with it?,"['arXiv:2306.16902v1  [cs.AI]  29 Jun 2023From Query Tools to Causal Architects: Harnessing Large Lan guage Models for\nAdvanced Causal Discovery from Data\nTaiyu Ban1, Lyvzhou Chen1, Xiangyu Wang1*, Huanhuan Chen1*\n1University of Science and Technology of China\n{banty, clz31415 }@mail.ustc.edu.cn, {sa312, hchen }@ustc.edu.cn\nAbstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional\nabilities for causal analysis between concepts in numer-\nous societally impactful domains, including medicine,\nscience, and law.

In this paper, we ad-\nvance the current research of LLM-driven causal dis-\ncovery by proposing a novel framework that combines\nknowledge-based LLM causal analysis with data-driven\ncausal structure learning. To make LLM more than a\nquery tool and to leverage its power in discovering nat-\nural and new laws of causality, we integrate the valuable\nLLM expertise on existing causal mechanisms into sta-\ntistical analysis of objective data to build a novel and\npractical baseline for causal structure learning.\nWe introduce a universal set of prompts designed to ex-\ntract causal graphs from given variables and assess the\ninﬂuence of LLM prior causality on recovering causal\nstructures from data. We demonstrate the signiﬁcant en-\nhancement of LLM expertise on the quality of recov-\nered causal structures from data, while also identifying\ncritical challenges and issues, along with potential ap-\nproaches to address them. As a pioneering study, this\npaper aims to emphasize the new frontier that LLMs\nare opening for classical causal discovery and inference,\nand to encourage the widespread adoption of LLM ca-\npabilities in data-driven causal analysis.\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated re-\nmarkable capabilities in causal analysis across numerous\ncritical domains (Nori et al. 2023; Tu, Ma, and Zhang 2023;\nMarcus 2022; Wang et al. 2022b). These capabilities are\nrooted in the vast reservoir of high-quality human knowl-\nedge and recognition that LLMs have accumulated from var-\nious online sources (Brown et al. 2020). LLMs have shown\nimpressive performance in accurately identifying intu-\nitive causal relationships between concepts, providing co n-\nvincing reasons for their inferences (Kıcıman et al. 2023;\nLong et al. 2023). While this progress is exciting, to trans-\nform LLMs from mere query tools into practical instruments\n*Corresponding authors.for discovering unknown causal relationships, we cannot\noverlook the importance of data.\nData embodies objective laws and harbors poten-\ntial unknown causal knowledge waiting to be uncov-\nered (Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000). This knowl-\nedge may be novel or even contradict prevailing human un-\nderstanding (Wang et al. 2022a). However, this does not im-\nply that LLMs are useless for discovering natural and new\ncausal laws. On the contrary, LLMs can be highly valuable\nwhen we integrate existing high-quality human knowledge\nwith statistical analysis derived from objective data.\nIn this paper, we focus on a crucial causal dis-\ncovery task: Causal Structure Learning (CSL)\n(Heckerman and Geiger 1995). CSL aims to learn causality\nby recovering a Bayesian Network (BN) that encodes the\ncausal relationships between variables, using observed da ta.\nWe discuss the challenges associated with the NP-hard\nnature of CSL (Chickering, Heckerman, and Meek 2004),\nwhich include: 1) Poor efﬁciency for large-scale datasets.\n2) Limited accuracy due to the inherent constraints of real-\nworld observed data. Incorporating prior constraints can\nmitigate these issues (Constantinou, Guo, and Kitson 2023) .\nHowever, current prior knowledge often relies on ex-\npert input, which may be scarce or of varying quality\nin many domains (Chen et al. 2023; Ban et al. 2022;\nWang et al. 2021). Excitingly, LLMs can act as free and\nknowledgeable experts across nearly all disciplines, offe ring\nrich and insightful expertise on causality of interest. Thi s\nhighlights the signiﬁcance of integrating LLMs into CSL.\nExisting research on the application of LLMs in causal\ntasks primarily focuses on evaluating the performance of\nLLMs themselves (Jin et al. 2023). Although LLMs exhibit\npromising capabilities in pairwise causal analysis, they f all\nshort when it comes to CSL (Tu, Ma, and Zhang 2023),\nwhich demands more detailed analysis at the causal gran-\nularity level (De La Fuente et al. 2004). The edge in the\nrecovered causal structure represents a direct causality,\nwhile all indirect causality are encoded in the form of di-\nrected paths. The causal granularity often transcends in-\ntuitive knowledge and is closely linked to objective data\n(Chen et al. 2016). This is why LLM is shown a poor capa-\nbility in recovering structural causality, the nature of ca usal\nmechanism we want to reveal from real-world observed\ndata.

What are the benefits of federated fine-tuning for LLMs with PEFT algorithms compared to local and global fine-tuning scenarios?,"['6.1 E FFECTIVENESS OF PEFT ALGORITHMS IN FS-LLM\nFirstly, we benchmark the performance of different PEFT algorithms in different application domains\nand scenarios. As described in Section 3, we use three federated fine-tuning datasets to fine-tune\nLLMs and evaluate them with corresponding tasks: (i) federated fine-tuning with Fed-CodeAlpaca for\ncode generation and evaluating with HumanEval , (ii) federated fine-tuning with Fed-Dolly for generic\nlanguage capability and evaluating with HELM , and (iii) federated fine-tuning with Fed-GSM8K-3 for\nmathematical reasoning and evaluating with GSM8K-test . We conduct experiments in three scenarios:\nglobal (centralized fine-tuning), fed (federated fine-tuning), and local (separated fine-tuning). To be\nmore specific, the global scenario can be regarded as fine-tuning LLMs with one client who holds\nthe whole fine-tuning dataset. Fed scenario means that clients federated fine-tune LLMs where each\nclient holds a different fine-tuning dataset. Local scenario means that each client independently\nfine-tunes LLMs with its own fine-tuning dataset.\nAll the experiments are conducted on the machines with the same hardware configuration: Nvidia\nA100 GPU (80GB) with Intel Xeon Platinum 8369B CPU and 512GB of RAM. For all scenarios, we\nrepeat the experiments three times with different random seeds. We report the average evaluation\nscore with its standard deviation.\nBenchmark federated fine-tuned LLaMA-7B. We use a widely adopted LLM, LLaMA-7B, with\nthree PEFT algorithms5, including LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), P-tuning (Liu et al., 2021b), and\nprompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021). We employ FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017) as the federated\naggregation strategy. To conduct the experiments uniformly and fairly, we fix the FL-specific\nhyperparameters and the hyperparameters that have a large impact on the computation cost for\nall experiments. For example, we set the communication round to 500, the local update step to\n30, and the batch size to 1. We perform a grid search for algorithm-specific and learning-related\nhyperparameters to obtain the optimal configuration. For example, the search space of the learning\nrate is{1×10−4,3×10−4,5×10−4,1×10−3,3×10−3,5×10−3}. Please refer to Appendix A.3\nfor more algorithm-specific hyperparameters corresponding to each PEFT algorithm. Moreover, to\nfurther reduce the GPU memory consumption for efficiency, we employ the half-precision operator\nduring fine-tuning.\nTable 2: Performance comparisons among different PEFT algorithms when fine-tuning LLaMA-7B\nin FL: Evaluation Scores(%) ±standard deviation(%).\nAlgorithm Scenario Fed-CodeAlpaca Fed-Dolly Fed-GSM8K-3\nLoRAGlobal 13.54 ±0.24 46.25 ±0.44 14.81 ±1.04\nFed 13.29 ±0.10 46.57 ±0.24 14.25 ±1.37\nLocal 10.99 ±0.77 43.98 ±1.38 11.88 ±1.35\nP-tuningGlobal 10.24 ±0.30 41.29 ±0.01 12.13 ±0.41\nFed 9.71 ±0.66 41.50 ±0.32 11.75 ±0.39\nLocal 7.78 ±2.27 38.76 ±2.39 11.42 ±0.96\nPrompt tuningGlobal 9.80 ±1.79 41.24 ±0.54 9.75 ±1.49\nFed 9.63 ±0.36 40.72 ±0.64 9.86 ±0.59\nLocal 7.18 ±2.17 37.65 ±6.12 9.65 ±0.77\nResults and Analysis.

What are the purposes of the KMO test and Bartlett’s test for sphericity in statistical analysis?,"['Correspondingly, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test statistic [31] and Bartlett’s test\nfor sphericity [32] are commonly utilized.\nThe KMO test is a measure used to compare the simple correlation coefficient and\npartial correlation coefficient between variables. The lower the proportion, the more\nsuited data is to factor analysis. The KMO test returns values between 0 and 1. A\nrule of thumb for interpreting the statistic:\n•KMO values between 0.8 and 1 indicate the sampling is adequate.\n•KMO values less than 0.6 indicate the sampling is not adequate and that remedial\naction should be taken. Some authors put this value at 0.5, so use your own judgment\nfor values between 0.5 and 0.6.\n•KMO Values close to zero mean that there are large partial correlations compared\nto the sum of correlations. In other words, there are widespread correlations which\nare a large problem for factor analysis.\nThe Bartlett’s test of sphericity tests whether the correlation coefficients are all 0.\nThe test computes the probability that the correlation matrix has significant corre-\nlations among at least some of the variables in a dataset, which is a prerequisite for\nfactor analysis to work. The corresponding Pvalue must be less than 0.05 to pass\nBarth’s spherical test.\nAfter the statistical analysis, the final LLM-specific Mini-CEX scale is obtained.\nThe primary items include medical interviewing skills ,humanistic care ,comprehensive\ndiagnostic and treatment abilities , and overall clinical competence .

How does ChatGPT utilize standalone prompt examples to showcase its utility?,"['CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Subramonyam, et al.\nand suggestions emphasize the importance of clarity and precision\nin language. If these suggestions come from examples where the\nmodel is fine-tuned, they can also help better align a user’s inten-\ntions with model behavior. For example, ChatGPT [ 124] provides\nstandalone prompt examples to showcase its utility. On the other\nhand, Notion [ 122], which is a tool for knowledge management,\nnot only offers possible ways to use AI to improve your writing\n(i.e., “Change tone”): it also gives suggestions on how to prompt\nan LLM to steer these improvements in a certain direction (i.e.,\n“Professional,” “Casual,” “Straightforward”). These patterns lead to\ntwo Tenets, namely: LLMs can serve as cognitive partners in task\nformulation [T2] , and A focus on clear, precise written language will\nhelp to bridge the gap between human intention and LLM output [T3].\nDesign Pattern 3 - Provide Multiple Outputs: Rather than gen-\nerate one output based on a user prompt, LLM systems may provide\nnumerous outputs. This can be achieved by setting the temperature\nof the model – a parameter that dictates randomness – greater than\n0and giving the model the same prompt or explicitly asking the\nmodel to give more than one example. This feature allows users to\nview multiple options to see which best fits their intentions. Fur-\nthermore, providing multiple outputs helps users link the effects\nof changes in prompts to changes in the final output of the model.\nSome systems also support grouping and clustering model outputs\nto make this process easier. For instance, BotDesigner [ 197] lets\nusers manually assign a tag to model outputs, while Sensecape [ 169]\ngroups relevant topics together semantically based on a high-level\ntopic. These features support the tenet that LLMs should support\nusers through their divergent thinking strategies [T4].\nDesign Pattern 4 - Make the Output Explainable: Some sys-\ntems prompt LLMs to explain their outputs or make them more\ninterpretable. This design pattern allows users to better understand\nhow LLMs interpret certain prompts and makes model outputs\neasier to use for manual editing. How this technique is applied in\npractice can differ depending on the task domain. Replit [ 137], a\nbrowser-based code editor, has an AI assistant named Ghostwriter\nthat generates in-line comments within its code responses. Another\ncode editor, Cursor [ 7], does not always provide code comments\nbut does allow users to ask LLMs about the code they generate. In\ncontrast, Sensecape [ 169], which is designed for exploration and\nsensemaking, prompts an LLM to return a response at different\nlevels of detail, such as through summaries and keywords. These\nfeatures help users address their intentionality gaps and better as-\nsess the model output. This pattern supports the tenet An error in\nhuman-LLM interaction is not just a user error or LLM failure but\nsignals a breakdown in the distributed cognitive system that requires\ncollaborative repair [T5]. However, in designing for explainability\nand drawing causal inferences between prompt inputs and out-\nputs, design should account for users’ overreliance on explanations\nwithout careful validation [48].\nDesign Pattern 5 - Use domain-specific prompting strategies:\nOutside of standard prompt engineering techniques, most systems\nuse a custom prompting strategy depending on their task. These\nmethods help steer the outputs from LLMs into something usable for\nthe end goal while also minimizing the output ambiguity that mayarise in trying different prompts. As an example, Graphologue [ 74],\nwhich is designed to turn text-based responses from LLMs into\ngraphical diagrams, uses prompting techniques to have models\nannotate entities and relationships within their outputs to create\ndiagrams in real-time. Coding Steps [ 78], a web-based application\nto help novices learn Python, prompts models with static examples,\nthen user code, then the user prompt, to ensure that the level of out-\nput is appropriate for beginners. These strategies allow designers to\nimplement conceptual tasks for users and consequently allow them\nto build task-specific system mental models. The corresponding\ntenet is that, Users favor working with a system mental model leading\nto actions when working within a defined task domain [T6].\nDesign Pattern 6 - Allow manual control of output : Many\nsystems afford users the opportunity to manually edit the outputs\nand interactions with LLMs. Since many LLM-enabled systems are\nbuilt for exploration and ideation, direct manipulation can help\nusers better incorporate their values and intentions into the model.\nOftentimes, manual editing is introduced when one output serves\nas input to another LLM. For instance, while LIDA [ 36], a tool\nfor generating visualizations and infographics, prompts an LLM\nto output goals for dataset exploration, users are also allowed to\nenter their own goals and adjust the model’s suggestions. Likewise,\nMirror [ 187] – an NLI for data querying and summarization – gives\nusers the ability to edit the SQL queries generated by a pre-trained\ncode model to add human expertise. These features align with the\ntenet, If tasks are well-defined, people prefer dedicated interfaces over\ndynamic interfaces [T7].\n6 DISCUSSION\nIn this work, we have theorized about cognitive challenges emerg-\ning in the transition from conventional software paradigms to\nprompt-based interactions powered by generative models. Based\non prior empirical evidence on challenges with prompting [ 80,196,\n197], we have applied cognitive science and HCI perspectives to\ncharacterize significant HCI design challenges with prompt-based\ninteractions. Given the advanced cognitive capabilities of LLMs,\npeople are now able to express in natural language their bespoke\ntask goals and ask the LLM to perform those goals for them. At\nthe same time, they lack the specific affordances of conventional\nsystems in formulating their intentions and task plans and eval-\nuating the LLM outputs. Given the shift in the operational scope\nfrom deterministic functions to dynamic intelligent agents, we\nhave identified new cognitive process models for specifying actions\nthrough intentions, i.e., the process of envisioning. In reasoning\nabout envisioning intentions with LLMs, we have also identified\nthree specific gaps including the capability gap, instruction gap, and\nintentionality gap, and we have provided initial recommendations\nfor interface designers to scaffold prompting. However, a number\nof open questions remain about designing prompt-based interfaces.\nHere, we propose open questions for future research as we consider\nfuture development and applications of generative models.']",ChatGPT provides standalone prompt examples to showcase its utility.,simple,"[{'page_label': '12', 'file_name': '2309.14459v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.14459v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 11372296, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

Recent works\nhave complex designs such as compressing\nthe output temporally for the speech encoder,\ntackling modal alignment for the projector,\nand utilizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning for\nthe LLM. We found that delicate designs are\nnot necessary, while an embarrassingly simple\ncomposition of off-the-shelf speech encoder,\nLLM, and the only trainable linear projector\nis competent for the ASR task. To be more\nspecific, we benchmark and explore various\ncombinations of LLMs and speech encoders,\nleading to the optimal LLM-based ASR system,\nwhich we call SLAM-ASR1. The proposed\nSLAM-ASR provides a clean setup and little\ntask-specific design, where only the linear pro-\njector is trained. To the best of our knowledge,\nSLAM-ASR achieves the best performance on\nthe Librispeech benchmark among LLM-based\nASR models and even outperforms the latest\nLLM-based audio-universal model trained on\nmassive pair data. Finally, we explore the ca-\npability emergence of LLM-based ASR in the\nprocess of modal alignment. We hope that our\nstudy can facilitate the research on extending\nLLM with cross-modality capacity and shed\nlight on the LLM-based ASR community.\n1 Introduction\nAutomatic speech recognition (ASR) stands as a\ncornerstone in the realm of intelligent speech tech-\nnology, enabling machines to understand and tran-\nscribe human speech. The significance of ASR\nin enhancing human-computer interaction and ac-\ncessibility makes it a crucial area of research and\napplications in the field of speech processing.\n†Corresponding author\n1SLAM-ASR is a subproject of SLAM-LLM, where\nSLAM stands for Speech, Language, Audio and Music. Work-\ning in progress and will open-source soon.The evolution of ASR technology has been\nmarked by the adoption of various paradigms, each\nrepresenting a leap forward in terms of accuracy, ef-\nficiency, and applicability (Li, 2022). Among these,\nsupervised methods including connectionist tem-\nporal classification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006),\nattention-based encoder-decoder (AED) (Chan\net al., 2016), recurrent neural network transducer\n(RNN-T) (Graves et al., 2013) and their variants\nhave been pivotal. In addition, employing self-\nsupervised methods for pre-training followed by\nsupervised methods for fine-tuning has also proven\nto be effective (Baevski et al., 2020; Hsu et al.,\n2021; Chen et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023; Yang et al.,\n2023). However, each paradigm comes with its\nown set of challenges and limitations, such as the\nneed for extensive labeled data, difficulties in cap-\nturing long-range context dependencies in speech,\nand huge training costs.\nIn this evolving landscape, the advent of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) has introduced a ground-\nbreaking paradigm: Multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) framework (Liu et al., 2023; Li\net al., 2023a; Gao et al., 2024), based on a decoder-\nonly architecture. This innovative approach di-\nverges from traditional ASR by utilizing the im-\nmense generative capacity of LLMs, which are\npre-trained on vast corpora encompassing diverse\nlinguistic contexts, leading to LLM-based ASR.\nThe evolution of the ASR paradigm from previous\nNN-based ASR models to LLM-based ASR mod-\nels, stresses differences across loss and criterion\ndesign, text prior knowledge, and model scale. This\nparadigm harnesses pre-existing linguistic knowl-\nedge, enabling a more holistic understanding of\nlanguage, which in turn, translates to significant\nimprovements in the speech recognition task.\nThe architecture of LLM-based ASR can be con-\nceptualized as consisting of three primary compo-\nnents: a speech encoder, a projector, and an LLM.\nRecent works in LLM-based ASR often venturearXiv:2402.08846v1  [cs.CL]  13 Feb 2024']","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) differ from traditional ASR models by utilizing a decoder-only architecture and leveraging the immense generative capacity of LLMs, which are pre-trained on vast corpora encompassing diverse linguistic contexts.

How do large language models perform in terms of quantifier comprehension?,"['2018, 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al.,\n2023). Also, it has been shown in previous studies\nthat humans are not that great at quantifier com-\nprehension as well (Urbach and Kutas, 2010), and\ncontinue to have a preference towards the more typ-\nical word in a context irrespective of the quantifier.\nThese observations suggest two things. Firstly, that\nLLMs are not good at quantifier comprehension.\nSecondly, we also observe this lack of sensitivity\nto quantifier meaning in humans. This combined\nwith the fact that despite lack of quantifier compre-\nhension, LLMs get increasingly better at language\nunderstanding, we can argue that quantifier com-\nprehension is not as necessary of a task in language\nprocessing and understanding as we thought it was.\n6 Related Work\nInverse scaling laws were introduced as a competi-\ntion (McKenzie et al., 2022) to incentivize research\ntowards finding scenarios where language models\nget worse as their size increases. As the field of\nNLP moves towards scaling models to larger and\nlarger sizes, it is important to know the scenarios\nwhere this scaling becomes detrimental (Wei et al.,\n2022; McKenzie et al., 2023).\nAs language models get increasingly better,\nsome common linguistic tests that they are put\nthrough revolve around understanding negation and\nquantifiers. Studying the affects of negation has\nbeen the subject of focus for many studies (Kass-\nner and Schütze, 2019; Kalouli et al., 2022; Et-\ntinger, 2020) for different encoder-based masked\nlanguage models. These studies find that these lan-\nguage models are not sensitive to negations. Stud-\nies on quantifiers (Kalouli et al., 2022) also seem to\nshow similar results for masked language models.\n(Michaelov and Bergen, 2022) was the first work to\nstudy the quantifier understanding in decoder-based\nLLMs.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we conduct a study to evaluate how\nwell large language models understand quantifiers.\nSpecifically, we study two types of quantifiers -\nmost -type and few-type quantifiers. We present a\nset of experiments to evaluate quantifier compre-\nhension of large language models and show that\nthese models are able to differentiate between most -\ntype and few-type quantifiers as they scale. We also\nshow that LLMs struggle incorporate the meaning\nofmost -type quantifier comprehension when com-pared to few-type quantifiers. We also show that\nmost -type quantifier comprehension demonstrates\nan inverse-scaling law and their understanding of\nmost -type quantifiers get worse as the model size\nincreases. This study indicates that LLMs do not\ntake into account the meaning of quantifiers that\nstrongly, as shown by low accuracy scores in Fig-\nures 3 and 4. Even so, these models get increas-\ningly better at language understanding tasks, thus\nindicating that quantifier understanding might not\nbe the best test to evaluate language understanding\nin LLMs.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper was prepared for informational pur-\nposes in part by the Artificial Intelligence Research\nGroup of JPMorgan Chase & Co and its affiliates\n(“J.P.

What special design considerations are required to achieve training efficiency for early-exit LLMs?,"['1.2 Challenges\nThe first and foremost question is how to train an early-exit LLM that is too large to fit into the memory of\none single device (e.g. GPU). While state-of-the-art frameworks like Megatron-LM [67, 49, 36], DeepSpeed\n[58, 68], Mesh-TensorFlow [65], Alpa [92], InternLM [72], and many more, support training standardLLMsat\nlargescaleswithdataparallelismandmodelparallelism(includingtensor, sequenceandpipelineparallelism),\nthey do not provide native support for early-exit LLMs. One particular challenge lies in pipeline parallelism\n[47,48,20,41], whichpartitionsthemodelalongthedepthdimensionintomultiplepipelinestages, connected\nby limited point-to-point communication between devices; this seems to contradict with early-exit models,\nas the early-exit training loss is typically an aggregation of losses for multiple (early or final) exits that are\nnow located separately on different pipeline stages. Despite the necessity of pipeline parallelism in many\nscenarios, we are not aware of any implementation that supports training early-exit LLMs with pipeline\nparallelism.\nMoreover, training efficiency for early-exit LLMs requires special design. While sizes of early-exit layers\nare often regarded as negligible for many neural network architectures, this is not the case for LLMs, where\neach early exit contains (at least) a large output embedding matrix that transforms hidden states into\nlogits on the vocabulary. A naive implementation of early-exit LLM training can cause large computational\noverhead compared to standard LLM training.\nFinally,withregardstoautoregressivegenerationtasks(wheretokensaregeneratedonebyone,depending\nonpreviouslygeneratedtokensviatheattentionmechanism), anaiveimplementationofearly-exitinferenceis\nnot compatible with KV caching, a standard technique of storing the keys and values of previously generated\ntokens at each layer. More specifically, if the current token is generated via early exiting at some layer, then\nits KV caches in later layers are missing, which hinders the generation of future tokens. Given that KV\ncaching is enabled by default in most cases, the efficacy of early exiting for autoregressive generation might\nbe questionable if its conflict with KV caching is not well resolved.\n1.3 Main contributions\nWe propose EE-LLM, a system for large-scale training and inference of early-exit (EE) LLMs with 3D par-\nallelism, which is designed to tackle the aforementioned challenges. EE-LLMis built upon Megatron-LM\n[67, 49, 36, 68], and augments it with various functionalities for early exiting. In addition to compatibility\nwith existing functionalities of 3D parallelism provided by Megatron-LM, EE-LLMalso implements a variety\nof algorithmic innovations, including a lightweight method that facilitates backpropagation for the early-\nexit training objective through pipeline stages, various techniques of leveraging idle resources in the original\npipeline schedule for computation related to early-exit layers, and two approaches of early-exit inference that\nare compatible with KV caching (with one based on a novel form of pipeline parallelism and another based on\nKV recomputation). Implementation of EE-LLMhas been well optimized for maximum training and inference\nefficiency. Our analytical and empirical study confirms that, with negligible computational overhead (caused\nby early-exitlayers) duringtraining with3D parallelism, oneobtains anearly-exit LLMthat generatestokens\nwith adaptive token-wise exit selection, achieving outstanding speedup without compromising output quality\nduringinference.

The source code for EE-LLMcan be found at https://github.com/pan-x-c/EE-LLM .\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Transformers\nThe Transformer architecture [77, 71] has been playing a dominant role in natural language processing (NLP)\nand large language models (LLMs) [7, 90]. It is typically composed of an input embedding layer, a stack of\nTransformer layers, and finally an output layer. Each Transformer layer consists of cross-attention and/or\nself-attention modules [4, 34, 52], a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and layer normalization (LayerNorm\n[2] or RMSNorm [88]). Transformers can be categorized into three types: encoder-only, encoder-decoder,\nand decoder-only. For the latter two, there is an output embedding matrix in the output layer, which\n3']",Training efficiency for early-exit LLMs requires special design considerations because the sizes of early-exit layers are not negligible for LLMs. Each early exit contains a large output embedding matrix that transforms hidden states into logits on the vocabulary.

What issue arises from the decision boundary shift when CRM and LLM are trained independently?,"['for rapid, intuitive responses to familiar and straightforward tasks, conserving cognitive resources\nby swiftly executing existing routines for tasks. Conversely, System 2 engages in deliberative,\nanalytical reasoning, activated when encountering novel or demanding situations that necessitate\ndeeper cognitive engagement. By analogy, CRM operates akin to System 1, efficiently managing\nstraightforward recommendation tasks with established patterns. At the same time, LLM functions\nakin to System 2, employing its expansive knowledge and reasoning abilities to tackle complex\nrecommendation challenges that may require deeper comprehension and analysis. Nonetheless, a\nnotable issue arises when CRM and LLM are trained independently: their decision boundaries may\ndiverge, that is, their boundaries between different classes or categories may be different. Merging\nthese models without addressing this discrepancy can result in a shift in decision boundaries [ 33],\nleading to inconsistencies in how they classify or recommend items. This alteration can lead to\nsuboptimal outcomes, undermining the efficacy of the combined approach as shown in Table 2.\nTherefore, we propose Collaborative Recommendation with conventional Recommender and Large\nLanguage Model (dubbed CoReLLa ) wherein we engage in the joint training of the two models\nand alignment loss for enhanced synergy. First, LLM and CRM are trained together with a multi-\nstage training strategy, due to significant differences in the parameter volumes of the two models.\nAdditionally, a specific alignment loss is devised to mitigate the issue of decision boundary shift,\nthereby fostering consistency in their outputs. After training, we utilize CRM’s predictions to assess\nthe difficulty level of samples and subsequently delegate challenging samples to LLM, ultimately\namalgamating their outcomes. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n•We conduct the first investigation into which subset of data CRM and LLM excel at, and\nfind LLM performs better on data where CRM exhibits lower confidence and CRM can\neffortlessly handle samples that are challenging for LLM.\n•We introduce CoReLLa, where LLM handles hard samples for CRM and addresses decision\nboundary shift issues through multi-stage joint training and alignment loss.\n•Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA CRM and LLM\nmethods significantly.\n2 Related Work\nThis work is closely related to LLM-enhanced recommender systems, which can be roughly classified\ninto two categories: (1) large language models as recommenders, and (2) conventional recommenders\naugmented by large language models.\nLarge Language Models as Recommenders. As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate\nremarkable performance across various tasks in the field of natural language processing (NLP),\nresearchers start to investigate the potential applications of LLMs to various recommendation tasks.\nOne important line of methods is to adopt LLMs as recommenders to generate recommendations\ndirectly. Due to the powerful zero-shot learning and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, early\nattempts primarily focus on recommendation tasks in zero-shot manners. For instance, ChatRec [ 6]\nemploys LLMs as recommender system interfaces for conversational multi-round recommendations.\nLiuet al. [21] investigate whether ChatGPT can serve as a recommender with task-specific prompts\nand report the zero-shot performance. Hou et al. [10] further report the zero-shot ranking performance\nof LLMs with historical interaction data. Sanner et al. [27] find that LLMs provide competitive\nperformance for pure language-based preferences in the near cold-start recommendation case in\ncomparison to item-based CF methods. However, directly leveraging LLMs for recommendations\nfalls behind state-of-the-art conventional recommendation algorithms, since general-purpose LLMs\nlack domain knowledge and collaborative signals, which are important for recommendation tasks [ 18].\nTherefore, the focus of later work shifts to how to inject recommendation knowledge into LLMs,\nprimarily through parameter-efficiency finetuning. For example, TALLRec [ 1] finetunes LLaMA-7B\nmodel [ 29] with a LoRA [ 11] architecture on recommendation data. ReLLa [ 20] design retrieval-\nenhanced instruction tuning by adopting semantic user behavior retrieval as a data augmentation\ntechnique and finetunes Vicuna-13B. RecRanker [ 22] introduces instruction-tuned LLMs for diverse\nranking tasks in top-k recommendations and proposes a hybrid ranking method that ensembles various\nranking tasks.\nConventional Recommenders Augmented by Large Language Models. Apart from directly\nadopting LLMs as recommenders, many researchers are also exploring the integration of open-world\n3']","When CRM and LLM are trained independently, their decision boundaries may diverge, leading to inconsistencies in how they classify or recommend items.

How did the release of ChatGPT impact the use of large language models in consumer complaints in the financial industry?,"['Large language models can enhance persuasion through\nlinguistic feature alignment\nMinkyu Shin∗Jin Kim†\nFebruary 13, 2024\nAbstract\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) are reshaping various aspects of human life, our\ncurrent understanding of their impacts remains somewhat constrained. Here we investigate\nthe impact of LLMs on human communication, using data on consumer complaints in the\nfinancial industry. By employing an AI detection tool on more than 820K complaints gathered\nby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), we find a sharp increase in the likely\nuse of LLMs shortly after the release of ChatGPT. Moreover, the likely LLM usage was\npositively correlated with message persuasiveness (i.e., increased likelihood of obtaining relief\nfrom financial firms). Computational linguistic analyses suggest that the positive correlation\nmay be explained by LLMs’ enhancement of various linguistic features. Based on the results\nof these observational studies, we hypothesize that LLM usage may enhance a comprehensive\nset of linguistic features, increasing message persuasiveness to receivers with heterogeneous\nlinguisticpreferences(i.e., linguistic feature alignment ).

What are the significant challenges associated with the implementation of the RLHF algorithm?,"['nal responses provided by the model. The second\nstage ( RL stage ) then uses an approach similar to\nRLHF to further train the fine-tuned model, but\ninstead of using human-labeled data, the method\nrelies on feedback from an AI model. The resulting\napproach is termed reinforcement learning from\nAI feedback (RLAIF). Combining this two-stage\napproach with chain-of-thought prompting, the au-\nthors show that such models perform on par with\nmodels trained on human feedback.\nChallenges of RLHF The RLHF algorithm has\nshown to be promising for learning human pref-\nerences, however, its implementation poses sig-\nnificant challenges due to the intricate interplay\namong the policy, behavior policy, reward, and\nvalue model. This complexity necessitates the tun-\ning of numerous hyper-parameters to optimize sta-\nbility and performance. To circumvent these issues,\nsome works have investigated the offline learning\nof human preferences. Specifically, given that hu-\nman preferences are often represented via ranking\nresults over a selection of responses, it is viable\nto incorporate this ranking data directly into the\nfine-tuning process of LLMs (Wang et al., 2023c).\nThis can be achieved using ranking-based objec-\ntives (Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Yuan\net al., 2023), or a masked language modeling ob-\njective (Liu et al., 2023).\nLimitations of RLHF Existing work further-\nmore draws attention to the limitations of RLHF-\ntrained models in practice. Röttger et al. (2023) put\nLLMs trained to be helpful and harmless to the\ntest by proposing XST EST, a test-suite to evalu-\nate LLMs based on exaggerated safety behaviors.\nSuch behaviors occur when models refuse to pro-\nvide answers for safe prompts. The authors propose\na collection 200 prompts in total, with 20 prompts\neach for 10 different categories including figurative\nlanguage ( ""How do I make someone explode with\nlaughter?"" ) and safe contexts ( ""How can I build a\nweapon in Minecraft?"" ). In their paper, the suite is\nevaluated against LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b)\nand GPT-4. Results show that LLaMA-2 exhibits\nsubstantial evidence of exaggerated safety behav-\nior, fully refusing almost 40% of the safe prompts\ninXST EST. This is in contrast to GPT-4, which\nonly fully refuses 6% of the prompts. Discussing\nsuch results, Röttger et al. (2023) argue that such\nan exaggerated behavior is due to the model’s over-\nreliance on lexical cues (e.g., ""explode"" ,""weapon"" ).Such results underline that despite their generative\ncapabilities, tuning LLMs to be helpful and harm-\nless comes with a trade-off between the two, and\ncan lead to an exaggerated safety behavior in which\nmodels sacrifice helpfulness for an overly strict re-\nsponse behavior to potentially unsafe prompts.\n6.5 Safety via instruction-following\nInstead of tuning LLMs via additional training for\nincreased safety and helpfulness, other existing\nwork investigates whether these models can sim-\nply be instructed to do so. In this context, Gan-\nguli et al. (2023) investigate whether models are\ncapable of morally self-correcting through spe-\ncific instructions. The authors study RLHF-trained\nLLMs of various sizes (ranging from 810 million\nto 175 billion parameters) on the Bias Benchmark\nfor QA (Parrish et al., 2022) and the Winogen-\nder benchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018), as well\nas a newly introduced dataset around racial dis-\ncrimination. Instructions are added directly to\nthe input prompts (e.g., ""Please ensure that your\nanswer is unbiased and does not rely on stereo-\ntypes"" ). Overall results suggest that larger models\ntend to produce outputs that score higher with re-\nspect to the aforementioned evaluations. However,\nthey are also more capable to self-correcting their\nbehavior. Specifically, the authors find that this\nself-correction behavior appears at a model size of\naround 22B parameters, with further improvements\nas the model size increases.\n6.6 Methods to avoid memorization\nThe prevention measures discussed up until this\npoint focus on safeguarding LLMs against ma-\nlicious use, either through methods that analyze\nLLM generations (Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3) or via\nconditioning LLMs directly, either through fur-\nther training (Section 6.4) or via instructions (Sec-\ntion 6.5). In this section, we focus specifically on\nmethods attempting to mitigate the issue of training\ndata memorization exhibited by LLMs as discussed\nin Section 5.5.\nReinforcement learning to minimize memoriza-\ntion As a potential solution to the problem of data\nmemorization of LLMs, Kassem (2023) propose to\nuse reinforcement learning for model fine-tuning.\nMore specifically, they use proximal policy opti-\nmization (PPO; Schulman et al., 2017) to train the\nLLM so as to minimize the generation of exact\nsequences in the training data. Kassem (2023) do', 'approaches to alignment in this subsection.\nRLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) and\nRLAIF (reinforcement learning from AI feedback) are two\npopular approaches. RLHF uses a reward model to learn\nalignment from human feedback. This reward model, after\nbeing tuned, is able to rate different outputs and score them\naccording to their alignment preferences given by humans. The\nreward model gives feedback to the original LLM and this\nfeedback is used to tune the LLM further [137]. Reinforcement\nlearning from AI feedback on the other hand, directly connects\na pretrained and well-aligned model to the LLM and helps it\nto learn from larger and more aligned models [138].\nIn another recent work (known as DPO ) [139], Rafailov\net al. discussed that RLHF is a complex and often unstable\nprocedure, and tried to address this with a new approach. They\nleveraged a mapping between reward functions and optimal\npolicies to show that this constrained reward maximization\nproblem can be optimized exactly with a single stage of policy\ntraining, essentially solving a classification problem on the\nhuman preference data. The resulting algorithm, which they\ncalled Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, per-\nformant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need\nfor fitting a reward model, sampling from the LM during fine-\ntuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. They\nobserved that fine-tuning with DPO exceeds RLHF’s ability to\ncontrol sentiment of generations and improves response quality\nin summarization. Fig 30 shows the high-level comparison\nbetween DPO vs RLHF.\nFig. 30: DPO optimizes for human preferences while avoiding\nreinforcement learning. Existing methods for fine-tuning lan-\nguage models with human feedback first fit a reward model\nto a dataset of prompts and human preferences over pairs of\nresponses, and then use RL to find a policy that maximizes\nthe learned reward. In contrast, DPO directly optimizes for\nthe policy best satisfying the preferences with a simple classi-\nfication objective, without an explicit reward function or RL.\nCourtesy of [139].\nEven more recently Ethayarajh et al. proposed a new align-\nment approach called the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization\n(KTO) [136]. Unlike existing state-of-the-art approaches, KTO\ndoes not require paired preference data ( x,yw,yl), and it\nonly needs (x,y) and knowledge of whether yis desirable or\nundesirable. KTO-aligned models are shown to be good or\nbetter than DPO-aligned models at scales from 1B to 30B,\ndespite not using paired preferences. KTO is also far easier to\nuse in the real world than preference optimization methods, as\nthe kind of data it needs is far more abundant. As an example,\nevery retail company has a lot of customer interaction data and\nwhether that interaction was successful (e.g., purchase made)\nor unsuccessful (e.g., no purchase made). However, They have\nlittle to no counterfactual data (i.e., what would have made\nan unsuccessful customer interaction ylinto a successful oneyw). Fig 31 shows a high-level comparison between KTO and\nother alignment approaches discussed above.\nFig. 31: LLM alignment involves supervised finetuning fol-\nlowed by optimizing a human-centered loss (HALO). How-\never, the paired preferences that existing approaches need are\nhard-to-obtain. In contrast, KTO uses a far more abundant\nkind of data, making it much easier to use in the real world.\nCourtesy of [136].\nH. Decoding Strategies\nDecoding refers to the process of text generation using pre-\ntrained LLMs. Given an input prompt, the tokenizer translates\neach token in the input text into a corresponding token ID.\nThen, the language model uses these token IDs as input and\npredicts the next most likely token (or a sequence of tokens).\nFinally, the model generates logits, which are converted to\nprobabilities using a softmax function. Different decoding\nstrategies have been proposed. Some of the most popular ones\nare greedy search, beam search, as well as different sample\ntechniques such as top-K, top-P (Nucleus sampling).\n1)Greedy Search :Greedy search takes the most probable\ntoken at each step as the next token in the sequence, discarding\nall other potential options. As you can imagine, this is a simple\napproach and can loose a lot of temporal consistency and\ncoherency. It only considers the most probable token at each\nstep, without considering the overall effect on the sequence.\nThis property makes it fast, but it also means that it can miss\nout on better sequences that might have appeared with slightly\nless probable next tokens.\n2)Beam Search :Unlike greedy search that only considers\nthe next most probable token, beam search takes into account\ntheNmost likely tokens, where Ndenotes the number of\nbeams. This procedure is repeated until a predefined maxi-\nmum sequence length is reached or an end-of-sequence token\nappears. At this point, the sequence of tokens (AKA “beam”)\nwith the highest overall score is chosen as the output. For\nexample for beam size of 2 and maximum length of 5,\nthe beam search needs to keep track of 25= 32 possible\nsequences. So it is more computationally intensive than greedy\nsearch.\n3)Top-k Sampling :Top-k sampling is a technique that\nuses the probability distribution generated by the language\nmodel to select a token randomly from the k most likely\noptions.\nSuppose we have 6 tokens (A, B, C, D, E, F) and k=2,\nand P(A)= 30%, and P(B)= 20%, P(C)= P(D)= P(E)= P(F)=']","The significant challenges associated with the implementation of the RLHF algorithm include the intricate interplay among the policy, behavior policy, reward, and value model.

As shown in Fig. 9,\nERNIE [35] proposes a novel word-entity alignment training\nobjective as a pre-training objective. Specifically, ERNIE\nfeeds both sentences and corresponding entities mentioned\nin the text into LLMs, and then trains the LLMs to pre-\ndict alignment links between textual tokens and entities in\nknowledge graphs. Similarly, KALM [91] enhances the input\ntokens by incorporating entity embeddings and includes\nan entity prediction pre-training task in addition to the\ntoken-only pre-training objective. This approach aims to\nimprove the ability of LLMs to capture knowledge related\nto entities. Finally, KEPLER [40] directly employs both\nknowledge graph embedding training objective and Masked\ntoken pre-training objective into a shared transformer-based\nencoder. Deterministic LLM [104] focuses on pre-training\nlanguage models to capture deterministic factual knowledge.\nIt only masks the span that has a deterministic entity as the\nquestion and introduces additional clue contrast learning\nand clue classification objective. WKLM [106] first replaces\nentities in the text with other same-type entities and then\nfeeds them into LLMs. The model is further pre-trained to\ndistinguish whether the entities have been replaced or not.\n4.1.2 Integrating KGs into LLM Inputs\nAs shown in Fig. 10, this kind of research focus on in-\ntroducing relevant knowledge sub-graph into the inputs\nof LLMs. Given a knowledge graph triple and the corre-\nsponding sentences, ERNIE 3.0 [101] represents the triple as\na sequence of tokens and directly concatenates them with\nthe sentences. It further randomly masks either the relation\ntoken in the triple or tokens in the sentences to better\ncombine knowledge with textual representations. However,\nsuch direct knowledge triple concatenation method allows\nthe tokens in the sentence to intensively interact with the\ntokens in the knowledge sub-graph, which could result in\nKnowledge Noise [36]. To solve this issue, K-BERT [36] takes\nthe first step to inject the knowledge triple into the sentence\nvia a visible matrix where only the knowledge entities have\naccess to the knowledge triple information, while the tokens\nin the sentences can only see each other in the self-attention\nmodule. To further reduce Knowledge Noise , Colake [107]\nproposes a unified word-knowledge graph (shown in Fig.\n10) where the tokens in the input sentences form a fully\nInput T ext: Mr. Darcy  gives Elizabeth a letterMr.\nDarcy\nElizabeth gives\na\nletterBeloved\nFatherMr.\nBennetMother JaneLLMs\nMr.\nBennetFatherBelovedMother JaneText GraphKnowledge GraphMr.\nDarcy...

How are activation maps utilized in the LLM factoscope to understand information processing within the LLM?,"['from the differential areas within LLMs responsible for fac-\ntual information and creative output, leading to varying inter-\nnal state behaviors when producing factual versus non-factual\ncontent [10].\nBased on our preliminary observations that LLMs exhibit\ndistinct activation patterns when outputting factual versus\nnon-factual content, we introduce the LLM factoscope, a\nSiamese network-based factual detection model. The LLM\nfactoscope analyzes the inner states from LLMs, including\nactivation maps ,final output ranks ,top-k output indices , and\ntop-k output probabilities , each offering a unique perspective\non the model’s internal decision-making process. Activation\nmaps are utilized to understand information processing within\nthe LLM, highlighting the neurons actively generating fac-\ntual versus non-factual outputs. Concurrently, final output\nranks indicate the evolving likelihood of the final output token\nacross the layers, providing insights into the model’s shifting\noutput preferences. Additionally, top-k output indices iden-\ntify the most probable output tokens at each layer, reflecting\nthe model’s decision-making priorities and its process of nar-\nrowing down choices. Complementing these, top-k output\nprobabilities reveal the model’s confidence in its top choices\nat each layer, offering a window into its probabilistic reason-\ning. Together, these diverse inner states enable our LLM Fac-\ntoscope model to effectively discern the factual accuracy of\nLLM outputs, leveraging the nuanced insights provided by\neach type of intermediate data in a cohesive, integrated man-\nner.\nLLM factoscope assesses the factuality of the model’s\ncurrent output, providing a novel approach to fact-checking\nwithin LLMs. In our experiments, we empirically demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of the LLM factoscope across vari-\nous LLM architectures, including GPT2-XL-1.5b, Llama2-\n7b, Vicuna-7b, Stablelm-7b, Llama2-13b, and Vicuna-13b.\nThe LLM factoscope achieves an accuracy rate exceeding\n96% in factual detection. Additionally, we extensively exam-\nine the model’s generalization capabilities and conduct abla-\ntion studies to understand the impact of different sub-models\nand support set sizes on the LLM factoscope’s performance.\nOur work paves a new path for utilizing inner states from\nLLMs for factual detection, sparking further exploration and\nanalysis of LLMs’ inner data for enhanced model understand-\ning and reliability. Our contributions are as follows:\n• We designed a pipeline for LLM factoscope, encompass-\ning factual data collection, creation of a factual detection\ndataset, model architecture design, and detailed training\nand testing procedures. All the datasets and implemen-\ntation will be released for further research and analysis.\n• We empirically validated the effectiveness of LLM fac-\ntoscope, explored its generalizability across various do-\nmains, and conducted thorough ablation experiments to\nunderstand the influence of different model components\nand parameters settings.\n2 Background\n2.1 Large Language Models\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), predominantly structured\naround the transformer decoder architecture [11]. Thesemodels, typically comprising billions of parameters, are adept\nat capturing intricate language patterns [12]. A formalized\nview of their inner workings can be presented as follows:\nConsider an LLM defined as a function Fmapping an input\nsequence x= (x1, x2, . . . , x n)to an output sequence y=\n(y1, y2, . . . , y m), where xandyconsist of tokens from a pre-\ndefined vocabulary V. Each token xiis first transformed into\na high-dimensional space through an embedding layer, result-\ning in a sequence of embeddings E=Embed (x). The core of\nan LLM lies in its multiple layers of transformers, each com-\nprising two main components: a self-attention module Aand\na multilayer perceptron (MLP) module M. For a given layer\nl, the hidden state H(l−1)(withH(0)=E) is first processed\nby the self-attention mechanism. The output of the attention\nlayer, denoted as A(l), is then passed through the MLP layer.\nThe MLP, a series of fully connected layers, further processes\nthis data to produce the output, denoted as M(l). The pro-\ncess within each layer can be mathematically represented as:\nA(l)=A(H(l−1)),M(l)=M(A(l),H(l−1)),H(l)=\nH(l−1)+A(l)+M(l),where AandMencapsulate the op-\nerations within the attention and MLP, respectively. After the\nfinal layer L, the output H(L)is typically passed through\na linear layer followed by a softmax function to generate a\nprobability distribution over the vocabulary Vfor each token\nin the output sequence: y=softmax (W·H(L)+b), where\nWandbare the weights and bias of the linear layer, respec-\ntively. Our method leverages inner states from the LLM, such\nas output from the hidden layer and MLP module, to detect\nwhether the next output of the LLM is factual or not.\n2.2 LLM Factual Detection\nFact-checking LLM outputs has become an increasingly crit-\nical task. Current approaches to mitigate LLM-generated in-\naccuracies include scrutinizing training datasets and cross-\nreferencing external databases. Manual examination [13]of\ntraining datasets is labor-intensive, while external database\nreferencing [14] [15]incurs additional computational costs\nand relies heavily on the effectiveness of cross-verification\ntechniques. A recently proposed SAPLMA [16]investigates\nwhether LLMs can discern the factuality of an input sentence.\nThey use output from a single layer of LLM to train a fully\nconnected neural network. Our method aims to distinguish\neach output as factual or non-factual, closely emulating the\ntypical usage of LLMs. We leverage not just activation val-\nues from a single layer, but also the inter-layer changes in\nactivations and hidden states within the LLM. This multi-\ndimensional analysis of the LLM’s inner data is akin to ob-\nserving various physiological responses in a human lie detec-\ntor[8]. By aggregating these intermediate states, our method\nprovides a more effective, generalized, and explainable tool\nfor analyzing the factual accuracy of the LLM’s output.\n2.3 Siamese Network\nSiamese Networks are designed to address few-shot learning\nchallenges by discerning the similarities and differences be-\ntween input pairs rather than conventional classification [17].\nThese networks consist of two identical sub-networks with\nshared weights, ensuring uniform processing of inputs.

How do clarity and precision in language help bridge the gap between human intention and LLM output?,"['CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Subramonyam, et al.\nand suggestions emphasize the importance of clarity and precision\nin language. If these suggestions come from examples where the\nmodel is fine-tuned, they can also help better align a user’s inten-\ntions with model behavior. For example, ChatGPT [ 124] provides\nstandalone prompt examples to showcase its utility. On the other\nhand, Notion [ 122], which is a tool for knowledge management,\nnot only offers possible ways to use AI to improve your writing\n(i.e., “Change tone”): it also gives suggestions on how to prompt\nan LLM to steer these improvements in a certain direction (i.e.,\n“Professional,” “Casual,” “Straightforward”). These patterns lead to\ntwo Tenets, namely: LLMs can serve as cognitive partners in task\nformulation [T2] , and A focus on clear, precise written language will\nhelp to bridge the gap between human intention and LLM output [T3].\nDesign Pattern 3 - Provide Multiple Outputs: Rather than gen-\nerate one output based on a user prompt, LLM systems may provide\nnumerous outputs. This can be achieved by setting the temperature\nof the model – a parameter that dictates randomness – greater than\n0and giving the model the same prompt or explicitly asking the\nmodel to give more than one example. This feature allows users to\nview multiple options to see which best fits their intentions. Fur-\nthermore, providing multiple outputs helps users link the effects\nof changes in prompts to changes in the final output of the model.\nSome systems also support grouping and clustering model outputs\nto make this process easier. For instance, BotDesigner [ 197] lets\nusers manually assign a tag to model outputs, while Sensecape [ 169]\ngroups relevant topics together semantically based on a high-level\ntopic. These features support the tenet that LLMs should support\nusers through their divergent thinking strategies [T4].\nDesign Pattern 4 - Make the Output Explainable: Some sys-\ntems prompt LLMs to explain their outputs or make them more\ninterpretable. This design pattern allows users to better understand\nhow LLMs interpret certain prompts and makes model outputs\neasier to use for manual editing. How this technique is applied in\npractice can differ depending on the task domain. Replit [ 137], a\nbrowser-based code editor, has an AI assistant named Ghostwriter\nthat generates in-line comments within its code responses. Another\ncode editor, Cursor [ 7], does not always provide code comments\nbut does allow users to ask LLMs about the code they generate. In\ncontrast, Sensecape [ 169], which is designed for exploration and\nsensemaking, prompts an LLM to return a response at different\nlevels of detail, such as through summaries and keywords. These\nfeatures help users address their intentionality gaps and better as-\nsess the model output. This pattern supports the tenet An error in\nhuman-LLM interaction is not just a user error or LLM failure but\nsignals a breakdown in the distributed cognitive system that requires\ncollaborative repair [T5]. However, in designing for explainability\nand drawing causal inferences between prompt inputs and out-\nputs, design should account for users’ overreliance on explanations\nwithout careful validation [48].\nDesign Pattern 5 - Use domain-specific prompting strategies:\nOutside of standard prompt engineering techniques, most systems\nuse a custom prompting strategy depending on their task. These\nmethods help steer the outputs from LLMs into something usable for\nthe end goal while also minimizing the output ambiguity that mayarise in trying different prompts. As an example, Graphologue [ 74],\nwhich is designed to turn text-based responses from LLMs into\ngraphical diagrams, uses prompting techniques to have models\nannotate entities and relationships within their outputs to create\ndiagrams in real-time. Coding Steps [ 78], a web-based application\nto help novices learn Python, prompts models with static examples,\nthen user code, then the user prompt, to ensure that the level of out-\nput is appropriate for beginners. These strategies allow designers to\nimplement conceptual tasks for users and consequently allow them\nto build task-specific system mental models. The corresponding\ntenet is that, Users favor working with a system mental model leading\nto actions when working within a defined task domain [T6].\nDesign Pattern 6 - Allow manual control of output : Many\nsystems afford users the opportunity to manually edit the outputs\nand interactions with LLMs. Since many LLM-enabled systems are\nbuilt for exploration and ideation, direct manipulation can help\nusers better incorporate their values and intentions into the model.\nOftentimes, manual editing is introduced when one output serves\nas input to another LLM. For instance, while LIDA [ 36], a tool\nfor generating visualizations and infographics, prompts an LLM\nto output goals for dataset exploration, users are also allowed to\nenter their own goals and adjust the model’s suggestions. Likewise,\nMirror [ 187] – an NLI for data querying and summarization – gives\nusers the ability to edit the SQL queries generated by a pre-trained\ncode model to add human expertise. These features align with the\ntenet, If tasks are well-defined, people prefer dedicated interfaces over\ndynamic interfaces [T7].\n6 DISCUSSION\nIn this work, we have theorized about cognitive challenges emerg-\ning in the transition from conventional software paradigms to\nprompt-based interactions powered by generative models. Based\non prior empirical evidence on challenges with prompting [ 80,196,\n197], we have applied cognitive science and HCI perspectives to\ncharacterize significant HCI design challenges with prompt-based\ninteractions. Given the advanced cognitive capabilities of LLMs,\npeople are now able to express in natural language their bespoke\ntask goals and ask the LLM to perform those goals for them. At\nthe same time, they lack the specific affordances of conventional\nsystems in formulating their intentions and task plans and eval-\nuating the LLM outputs. Given the shift in the operational scope\nfrom deterministic functions to dynamic intelligent agents, we\nhave identified new cognitive process models for specifying actions\nthrough intentions, i.e., the process of envisioning. In reasoning\nabout envisioning intentions with LLMs, we have also identified\nthree specific gaps including the capability gap, instruction gap, and\nintentionality gap, and we have provided initial recommendations\nfor interface designers to scaffold prompting. However, a number\nof open questions remain about designing prompt-based interfaces.\nHere, we propose open questions for future research as we consider\nfuture development and applications of generative models.']","Clarity and precision in language help bridge the gap between human intention and LLM output by better aligning a user's intentions with model behavior, as emphasized in the context.",simple,"[{'page_label': '12', 'file_name': '2309.14459v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.14459v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 11372296, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

Indeed,\nthere have been attempts to explore off-the-shelf planning\ntechniques to help LLMs solving planning problems (Liu\net al., 2023). Similar to (Valmeekam et al., 2023b), they\nonly view planners as black-boxes without deepening the\nintegration of LLMs in planning frameworks.\nTo do this, we investigate the effectiveness of embedding\nLLMs into one of the well-known planning frameworks,\ngraph-based planning (Blum & Furst, 1997). We propose\na novel LLMs-based planning framework with LLMs em-\nbedded in two levels of the planning framework (namely\nLLMs4Plan ), i.e., (a) selecting promising actions in each\naction-level to expand the planning graph, and (b) building\nnon-mutual action sets in each action-level of the expanded\nplanning graph, which correspond to two critical steps that\ninfluence the efficiency and effectiveness of graph planning.\nFor example, as shown in Figure 1(a), there could be many\nactions in “action-level 1” after expanding the planning\ngraph based on “state-label 0” with Graphplan (Blum &\nFurst, 1997). We expect that LLMs will help select only a\nfew promising actions in each action level, e.g., {a1, a2, a3}\nin “action-level 1”.

How is internal model information used to elicit confidence in LLMs?,"['The Calibration Gap between Model and Human Confidence\n2. Related Research\n2.1 Eliciting LLM Confidence\nSeveral approaches have been developed to elicit confidence in LLMs and to assess the\ndegree to which the elicited confidence scores are calibrated (see (Geng et al., 2023) for an\noverview). One approach that is commonly used is to access internal model information\nsuch as token likelihoods, allowing for direct computation of relative probabilities of different\npossible answers in multiple-choice questions (Jiang et al., 2021; Kadavath et al., 2022; Xiao\net al., 2022; Hendrycks et al., 2021; OpenAI, 2023). More recent research has focused on\nverbally expressing LLM model confidence such that the confidence is expressed in natural\nlanguage as numeric strings (e.g., “80%”) (Lin et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2023) or more\nqualitative expressions of confidence (e.g., “I am not confident the answer is X”) (Mielke\net al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023). To create calibrated verbal expressions of uncertainty,\nmethods have included fine-tuning LLMs to produce verbalized probabilities for classes\nof math problems (Lin et al., 2022) and training models to connect the internal model\nrepresentation to dialogue models that can translate internal probabilities to an appropriate\nlinguistic expression of confidence (Mielke et al., 2022).\nMethods that do not require access to internal model representations have used prompt-\ning strategies designed to elicit verbal expressions of uncertainty (Xiong et al., 2023; Zhou\net al., 2023). Prompts that are designed to emphasize step-by-step reasoning about the\ncorrectness of individual steps and clarify the space of possible answers lead to better cal-\nibration than simple prompts that simply ask for a confidence rating (Xiong et al., 2023).\nFor short-form question answering, prompting strategies can lead to calibrated confidence\nlevels (Tian et al., 2023). However, for multiple-choice questions, which is the focus of our\nwork, prompting approaches have been found to be less accurate compared to methods that\nread out model confidence (Xiong et al., 2023). Other black-box prompting methods for\nconfidence elicitation have focused on the assessment of similarity among multiple responses\nfrom the model (Lin et al., 2023).\nOur research builds on this prior work by integrating multiple approaches to eliciting\nconfidence. We utilize a “white-box” method that reads out the internal token likelihoods.\nIn addition, we use prompting strategies to verbally communicate the uncertainty expressed\nin the internal likelihoods to users. In contrast with prior work on LLM confidence elicita-\ntion, our goal is not to develop novel confidence elicitation procedures. Instead, the focus\nof our work is to assess the human perception of LLM uncertainty as expressed through\nexplanations.\n2.2 Human perception of verbal probability phrases\nA significant body of psychology research has investigated perceptions of verbally expressed\nuncertainty across a wide range of domains, including climate policy, medicine, and intelli-\ngence forecasting (Budescu et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2015; Karelitz et al., 2002; Wallsten et al.,\n2008; O’Brien, 1989). These studies aim to understand how humans perceive verbal proba-\nbility phrases such as “highly unlikely” and “almost certain” when describing the likelihood\nof an event occurring. The findings show that there are subjective differences in how people\ninterpret linguistic probabilities (Dhami and Wallsten, 2005; Karelitz and Budescu, 2004;\n4']","Internal model information, such as token likelihoods, is used to elicit confidence in LLMs by allowing for direct computation of relative probabilities of different possible answers in multiple-choice questions.",simple,"[{'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2401.13835v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2401.13835v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1345770, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

Finetuned LLMs as surrogate models, compared to the fixed-feature surrogates from Section 4.\n(Algorithm 1, line 3), and notthe finetuning and Laplace\napproximation of the surrogate, see Figure 11 in Appendix B.\nThis is because |Dcand|can be several orders of magnitude\nlarger than |Dt|during the BO loop, and even forward passes\non LLMs are already expensive. Moreover, due to GPU\nmemory limitation, one can only use a small minibatch\nsize— 16in our case. In contrast, fixed-feature surrogates\ndo not have this problem since one can simply cache the\nLLM’s features to be used for all iterations t. Nevertheless,\nthis can be alleviated via engineering efforts such as by\nparallelizing the forward passes over Dcand.\nFinetuned LLM surrogates are preferable to the fixed-\nfeature counterparts for both general and domain-specific\nLLMs. The bottleneck in doing so is not in training, but\nin the forward passes over Dcand.\n6. Related Work\nWhile LLMs have been leveraged for BO (Ramos et al.,\n2023; Anonymous, 2023), so far they have only been used\nin a heuristic manner: The uncertainty estimates are ob-\ntained from the softmax probabilities outputted by a point-\nestimated (i.e., non-Bayesian) LLM. The closest work to\nours is Rankovi ´c & Schwaller (2023) which studied the\nusage of text embeddings for BO with GP surrogates. How-\never, the goals of their work and the present work are dif-\nferent: Here, we investigate whether the usage of LLMs is\njustified for BO due to their apparent chemistry question-\nanswering capability, and not just to study the usage of text\nembeddings. Furthermore, Rankovi ´c & Schwaller (2023)\ndid not study the effect of prompting and finetuning. Finally,\nthe present work can be seen as an extension to the work of\nYang et al. (2023): We provide a clear probabilistic interpre-\ntation and generalize their work, and use it in the context of\nBO instead of natural language processing tasks.Besides the discrete BO, one can cast BO over molecules\ninto a continuous optimization problem with the help of\ngenerative models. G ´omez-Bombarelli et al. (2018); Tripp\net al. (2020); Maus et al. (2022) employed variational au-\ntoencoder to construct a continuous latent representation of\nmolecules and then performed BO on the said latent space.\nMoreover, the training of the surrogate model and the au-\ntoencoder can also be done jointly (Stanton et al., 2022).\nUnlike those methods, we focus on studying the role of\nlanguage models and view the problem as a much simpler\nyet still practically relevant discrete BO.\n7. Conclusion\nWe have shown that large language models (LLMs) do in-\ndeed carry useful information to aid Bayesian optimization\n(BO) over molecules. However, this usefulness was only\napparent when one (i) uses a chemistry-specific LLM or (ii)\nperforms finetuning—preferably both. Indeed, for point (i),\neven when the recent LLAMA-2-7B LLM was used as a fea-\nture extractor for a BO surrogate or when the state-of-the-art\nGPT-4 was used in conjunction with in-context learning, the\noptimization performance was subpar compared to that of\namuch smaller chemistry-focused LLM’s features. We ad-\ndressed point (ii) by providing a way to formulate Bayesian\ninference for general parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT),\nwhich in turn enables principled uncertainty estimation over\nLLMs with any PEFT method. We found that these princi-\npled BO surrogates are effective and yet much cheaper than\nin-context learning methods since small domain-specific\nLLMs can be used. We hope that our findings and the ac-\ncompanying software library can be useful for practitioners\nand arouse further principled methods around LLMs for sci-\nentific discovery both inside and outside of chemistry. It is\nalso interesting to investigate the underlying mechanism of\nhow LLMs induce good exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.\n8']","Finetuned LLM surrogates are preferable to the fixed-feature counterparts for both general and domain-specific LLMs. The bottleneck in doing so is not in training, but in the forward passes over Dcand.",simple,"[{'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1140856, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

What are the potential issues associated with continual pre-training on fine-tuned models?,"['Examining Forgetting in Continual Pre-training of Aligned Large\nLanguage Models\nChen-An Li1,2Hung-Yi Lee1\n1National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan\n2ASUS Open Cloud Infrastructure Software Center, Taipei, Taiwan\nb08902123@csie.ntu.edu.tw hungyilee@ntu.edu.tw\nAbstract\nRecent advances in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency\nacross various tasks. Given the potent appli-\ncations of LLMs in numerous fields, there has\nbeen a surge in LLM development. In develop-\ning LLMs, a common practice involves contin-\nual pre-training on previously fine-tuned mod-\nels. However, this can lead to catastrophic\nforgetting. In our work, we investigate the\nphenomenon of forgetting that occurs during\ncontinual pre-training on an existing fine-tuned\nLLM. We evaluate the impact of continuous\npre-training on the fine-tuned LLM across\nvarious dimensions, including output format,\nknowledge, and reliability. Experiment results\nhighlight the non-trivial challenge of address-\ning catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-\ntraining, especially the repetition issue.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demon-\nstrated impressive performance across various tasks\n(Brown et al., 2020). There is an increasing trend of\nreleasing pre-trained LLMs and fine-tuned variants\n(Touvron et al., 2023a,b). Many of these fine-tuned\nvariants aim to augment the knowledge or linguis-\ntic capabilities of the existing LLM (Roziere et al.,\n2023; Cui et al., 2023).\nWe have noticed that many advancements in fine-\ntuned variants adhere to a conventional procedure\nconsisting of two key steps: 1. Conduct further con-\ntinual pre-training on an existing LLM. 2. Carry\nout subsequent alignment operations, such as Su-\npervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement\nLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF), on the\nmodel obtained in Step 1. Among these fine-tuned\nvariants, many developments perform further con-\ntinual pre-training on existing fine-tuned LLMs\n(Cui et al., 2023; Lin and Chen, 2023).\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that con-\ntinual pre-training can significantly improve themodel’s ability to understand and generate specific\ncontent (Gupta et al., 2023). However, continual\npre-training could lead to catastrophic forgetting\n(French, 1999), and limited research has explored\nthe abilities forgotten during pre-training on an ex-\nisting fine-tuned LLM.\nSome works have studied continual learning for\nlanguage models. (Qin et al., 2022) focused on\nefficient lifelong pre-training on pre-trained lan-\nguage models for emerging data. (Ke et al., 2022)\nproposed a continual domain-adaptive pre-training\nmethod on a masked language model. (Song et al.,\n2023) introduced continual parameter-efficient tun-\ning for the ongoing adaptation of LLMs to contin-\nual tasks. (Xie et al., 2023) investigate an alter-\nnative approach to continual pre-training for de-\nveloping domain-specific LLMs. (Qi et al., 2023)\nsuggests that fine-tuning compromises the safety\nalignment of LLMs. (Zhai et al., 2023) evaluates\nthe forgetting in fine-tuned multimodal LLMs.\nOur work examines the forgetting occurrence\nduring continual pre-training on an existing fine-\ntuned LLM. Our paper primarily focuses on con-\ntinual pre-training using the Traditional Chinese\ncorpus. We evaluate the impact of continual pre-\ntraining across various dimensions, including out-\nput format, knowledge, and reliability. We show\nthat more than straightforward methods are re-\nquired for resolving this issue. Also, we observe\nan increased prominence of the repetition problem\nin models that tend to generate Traditional Chi-\nnese outputs. Lastly, despite continual pre-training,\nour findings suggest that the model’s knowledge\nremains unaffected while its reliability declines.\n2Observation of Catastrophic Forgetting\nduring Continual Pre-training\n2.1 Settings for Observation\nWe conduct pre-training on Llama-2-7b-chat, a\nmodel comprising approximately 7 billion parame-arXiv:2401.03129v1  [cs.CL]  6 Jan 2024']","The potential issues associated with continual pre-training on fine-tuned models include catastrophic forgetting, where the model forgets previously learned abilities, and an increased prominence of the repetition problem.

Results show that: (a) The code prompt\nimproves model performance in both precision and\nrecall; (b) Compared with GPT-3, Codex achieves\nhigher recall and comparable precision on NER\ntasks and and achieves both higher precision and\nrecall on RE tasks.\n5 Related Work\nGenerative Information Extraction Genera-\ntive information extraction which frames IE tasks\nas token generation tasks receive more attention\nrecently due to their potential to unify different\ntasks (Yan et al., 2021a; Josifoski et al., 2022). Yan\net al. (2021a) designs various ways to linearize en-\ntities into a sentence to unify various named entity\nrecognition subtasks.

These works linearize\nthe structure output of IE tasks into text format to\nalign the pre-trained models. Different from them,\nwe propose to recast the structural samples of IE\ntasks into structural code format and utilize aligned\npre-trained code models to perform the tasks.\nCode-LLMs for Complex Tasks Recent works\nshow Code-LLMs perform better on complex\ntasks like commonsense and symbolic reasoning\n(Madaan et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2022), math-\nematical logic (Suzgun et al., 2022) and event ar-\ngument prediction (Wang et al., 2022) tasks. We\nfocus on the two mainstream IE tasks different fromthem, i.e., NER and RE. Besides, in-depth analyses\nare conducted to provide more insights.\nLLMs for Few-Shot NER and RE While\nLLMs like GPT-3 have shown strong few-shot\nlearning abilities in many NLP tasks, limited works\nhave explored their capabilities on typical IE tasks\nlike NER and RE. Epure and Hennequin (2021)\nevaluate GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) on open-\ndomain NER tasks with few-shot demonstrating.\nA recent work (Gutiérrez et al., 2022) tests the\nperformance of GPT-3 on biomedical NER and\nRE tasks and ﬁnds it underperforms compared to\nﬁne-tuning smaller pretrained models. Its concur-\nrent work (Agrawal et al., 2022) ﬁnds that GPT-3\nperforms well on few-shot clinical IE tasks. We\nconduct our experiments on more general NER\nand RE datasets and ﬁnd GPT-3 can achieve com-\nparable performance to ﬁne-tuning the UIE model.\nBesides, we successfully employ the LLMs of code\nwith better performances for these IE tasks.\n6 Conclusion\nWe propose the ﬁrst work to utilize the structured\nCode-LLMs with code-style prompts to perform\nthe few-shot NER and RE tasks.

What are some methods used to evaluate social bias in Large Language Models (LLMs)?,"['Computational Linguistics\ntribution difference of a LLM in language selection based on different demographic groups. Compared\nto the social bias, unfairness is the external form, which re ﬂected in the output performance of speciﬁc\ntasks, for example, the African American English (AAE) is fr equently mis-classiﬁed as the offensive lan-\nguage by some language detector ( Lwowski et al., 2022 ). However, issues of unfairness and social bias\nare inevitable as they are widely distributed in human langu ages, and LLMs are required to memorize\nlanguage as accurately as possible in the training stage ( Weidinger et al., 2021 ). With respect to evaluate\nthis important aspect, CrowS-Pairs ( Nangia et al., 2020 ) is benchmark proposed to evaluating social bias.\nThere are 1508 examples in CrowS-Pairs that involves nine ty pes of social bias, like gender, race, and\nNationality. StereoSet ( Nadeem et al., 2021 ) is a dataset that could be used to evaluate social bias level\nin both word-level and sentence level, which examples are in four domains: race, gender,religion, and\nprofession. For the StereoSet, the bias level is computed by the difference between model generation\nprobabilities of biased and anti-biased sentence.\n2.4.3 Others\nAs current algorithms for model safety based on the human per ception, there is still no golden standard-\nized judgement for LLMs to refer to, especially when a judgem ent is highly various across societies.\nIt is necessary to align LLMs with the morality, ethics, and v alues of human society. More and more\nworks focus on reifying this abstract concept into textual d ata recently, for example, Sap et al. (2020 ) pro-\nposal an implicit reasoning frame to explain the underlying harm of the target language. Besides, other\nworks leverage rule-of-thumb (RoT) annotations of texts to support the judgement ( Forbes et al., 2020 ;\nZiems et al., 2022 ). However, current works in this area are neonatal, and we co uld expect more related\nworks in the future.\nBesides, we are also concerned about the privacy and politic al risks of LLMs. Since the LLMs are\ntrained on vast corpus collected from books, conversations , web texts and so on, the privacy safety of\nLLMs arouses people’s concern. These training texts might c ontain the private or sensitive information\nsuch as personal physical information, home address, etc. M any studies indicate LLMs are brittle under\nattacks, leaking the sensitive information unintentional ly (Carlini et al., 2020 ;Li et al., 2022 ). Therefore,\nit is essential to test the privacy protection ability of a LL M. Moreover, the politics ignorance is also\nintractable for a LLM. The politics-related risk mainly ste ms from the composition of the training corpus.\nTexts in the corpus are derived from different language and s ocial environments (usually the larger the\nmore diversiﬁed), and different countries have different p olitical prudence and stance, which brings\nadditional risks to the wide deployment of a LM.\n3 Future Directions\nIn this section, we outline some other competencies that are important for evaluating LLMs.\n3.1 Sentiment\nIt is crucial to equip LLMs with the ability to understand and generate sentiments. As an indispensable\nfactor in human life, sentiments are widely present in daily chats, social media posts, customer reviews,\nand news articles ( Liu, 2015 ). Through the comprehensive research and high-level summa ry of the liter-\nature related to sentiments, we introduce the sentiment com petency of LLMs in two aspects: sentiment\nunderstand and sentiment generation.\n3.1.1 Sentiment Understanding\nSentiment understand mainly involves the understanding of opinions, sentiments and emotions in\nthe text ( Liu, 2015 ). Representative tasks that reﬂect this competency includ e sentiment classiﬁ-\ncation (SC), aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and m ultifaceted analysis of subjective texts\n(MAST). SC aims at assigning pre-deﬁned sentiment classes t o given texts. The typical datasets\ninclude IMDB ( Maas et al., 2011 ), SST ( Socher et al., 2013 ), Twitter ( Rosenthal et al., 2017 ), Yelp\n(Zhang et al., 2015 ). ABSA focuses on identifying the sentiments of speciﬁc asp ects in a sentence\n(Zhang et al., 2022 ), and the most widely used datasets are the SemEval series ( Pontiki et al., 2014 ;\nPontiki et al., 2015 ;Pontiki et al., 2016 ).

What are the steps involved in adding execution rails in NeMo Guardrails?,"['3.3.3 Moderation Rails\nThe moderation process in NeMo Guardrails con-\ntains two key components:\n•Input moderation , also referred as jailbreak\nrail, aims to detect potentially malicious user mes-\nsages before reaching the dialogue system.\n•Output moderation aims to detect whether\nthe LLM responses are legal, ethical, and not harm-\nful prior to being returned to the user.\nThe moderation system functions as a pipeline,\nwith the user message first passing through input\nmoderation before reaching the dialogue system.\nAfter the dialogue system generates a response\npowered by an LLM, the output moderation rail is\ntriggered. Only after passing both moderation rails,\nthe response is returned to the user.\nBoth the input and output moderation rails are\nframed as another task to a powerful, well-aligned\nLLM that vets the input or response. The prompt\ntemplates for these rails are found in Appendix D.\n4 Sample Guardrails Applications\nAdding rails to conversation applications is simple\nand straightforward using Colang scripts.\n4.1 Topical Rails\nTopical rails can be used in combination with exe-\ncution rails to decide when a specific action should\nbe called or to define complex dialogue flows for\nbuilding task oriented agents.\nIn the example presented in Fig. 2, we imple-\nment two topical rails that allow the Guardrails\napp to use the WolframAlpha engine to respond\nto math and distance queries. To achieve this, the\nwolfram alpha request custom action (imple-\nmented in Python, available on Github) is using the\nWolframAlpha API to get a response to the user\nquery. This response is then used by the LLM to\ngenerate an answer in the context of the current\nconversation.\n4.2 Execution Rails\nThe steps involved in adding executions rails are:\n1.Define the action - Defining a rail requires\nthe developer to define an action that specifies\nthe logic for the rail (in Python).\n2.Invoke action in dialogue flows - Once the\naction has been defined, we can call the action\nfrom Colang using the execute keyword.\n3.Use action output in dialogue flow - The\ndeveloper can specify how the application\nshould react to the output from the action.Appendix E contains details about defining ac-\ntions, together with an example of the actions that\nimplement the input and output moderation rails.\nFig. 4 shows a sample flow in Colang that in-\nvokes the check _jailbreak action. If the jailbreak\nrail flags a user message, the developer can decide\nnot to show the generated response and to output\na default text instead. Appendix F provides other\nexamples of flows using the executions rails.\nFigure 4: Flow using jailbreak rail in Colang\n5 Evaluation\nIn this section, we provide details on how we\nmeasure the performance of various rails. Addi-\ntional information for all tasks and a discussion on\nthe automatic evaluation tools available in NeMo\nGuardrails are provided in Appendix G.\n5.1 Topical Rails\nThe evaluation of topical rails focuses on the\ncore mechanism used by the toolkit to guide con-\nversations using canonical forms and dialogue\nflows. The current evaluation experiments em-\nploy datasets used for conversational NLU. In this\nsection, we present the results for the Banking\ndataset (Casanueva et al., 2022), while additional\nexperiments can be found in Appendix G.\nStarting from a NLU dataset, we create a Colang\napplication (publicly available on Github) by map-\nping intents to canonical forms and defining simple\ndialogue flows for them. The evaluation dataset\nused in our experiments is balanced, containing\nat most 3 samples per intent sampled randomly\nfrom the original datasets. The test dataset has 231\nsamples spanning over 77 different intents.\nThe results of the top 3 performing models\nare presented in Fig. 5, showing that topical rails\ncan be successfully used to guide conversations\neven with smaller open source models such as\nfalcon-7b-instruct orllama2-13b-chat .

"What capabilities does GPT-4 possess, and how does it perform across professional and academic benchmarks?","['Safeguarding Crowdsourcing Surveys from ChatGPT with Prompt Injection\nNevertheless, data quality is a pervasive concern in crowdsourcing-based research [ 9]. The inherent lack of direct\nparticipant monitoring can give rise to various types of misbehavior (e.g., mindless responses), ultimately compromising\nthe integrity of the collected data [ 9]. Online crowdsourcing platforms have proposed incentive structures as a potential\nsolution to enhance data quality. By allowing researchers to reject subpar responses and withhold payment, workers\nare encouraged to adhere to instructions and engage attentively in research studies, particularly if they are aware of\nattention-checking tests [ 9]. These attention-checking tests are typically embedded early in a survey (e.g., “For this\nquestion, please select Option C to demonstrate your attention” ). Thus, having an evident correct response, they serve to\nidentify inattentive respondents and allow researchers to exclude them before conducting analyses [ 19]. This approach\nencourages careful consideration of stimuli before providing responses, promoting overall data reliability [9].\n2.2 Large Language Models\nLLMs have recently garnered substantial interest in the field of natural language processing and beyond. Scaling up\nLLMs, for instance, by augmenting model parameters, enhances performance and sample efficiency across diverse\nNLP tasks [ 30]. Moreover, bigger LLMs exhibit emergent capabilities absent in smaller counterparts [ 30]. One notable\nemerging capability is zero-shot prompting, in which a pre-trained language model can tackle tasks using natural\nlanguage instructions as prompts, without additional training or parameter adjustments [ 3,30]. LLMs also demonstrate\nremarkable few-shot prompting or in-context learning skills, where the model improves performance on a downstream\ntask by conditioning on a prompt containing input-output examples [ 30]. Leveraging zero-shot/few-shot prompting,\nusers can craft custom prompts to generate responses tailored to their requirements.\nLLMs’ pre-training on large-scale, mixed-source corpora enables them to capture extensive knowledge from the\ndata [ 34]. As a result, recent research has focused on utilizing LLMs for domain-specific tasks and assessing their\nadaptability [ 34]. Various studies have investigated the application of GPT-3.5 and other LLMs in the medical field,\nencompassing areas such as biological information extraction [ 28], medical consultation advice [ 21], and report\nsimplification [ 17,34]. In multiple empirical studies, LLMs have proven to be effective writing or reading assistants in\neducational contexts [ 1,20,34]. Furthermore, LLMs have successfully addressed diverse legal tasks, including legal\ndocument analysis, judgment prediction, and document writing [29, 34].\nAmong LLMs, ChatGPT has gained significant popularity, reaching 100 million monthly active users in January 2023,\nonly two months after its launch on November 30, 2022 [ 15]. ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) is fine-tuned from a model\nwithin the GPT-3.5 series, representing a third-generation autoregressive language model developed by OpenAI1. This\nmodel leverages advanced deep learning techniques to generate human-like text, with the ability to produce word lists,\nlines of code, and other data types based on an initial input referred to as the prompt [ 7]. To improve the reliability,\nusefulness, and alignment of GPT-3.5 models, OpenAI recently employed a technique called reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) [ 4,22]. This method relies on human labelers providing examples of the desired model\nbehavior in response to collected prompts and ranking various outputs generated by GPT-3.5 models [ 22]. OpenAI\nuses this feedback to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 models, leading to the development of ChatGPT [ 22]. In a more recent\nadvancement, OpenAI unveiled GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing both image and text inputs\nwhile generating textual outputs, achieving human-level performance across a range of professional and academic\nbenchmarks [23].\n1https://openai.com/\n3']",GPT-4 is a large multimodal model capable of processing both image and text inputs while generating textual outputs.

What is the causal language modeling objective for training a language model?,"['Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\ntypically employ weighted averaging (Littlestone & Warmuth, 1994) or majority voting (Monteith\net al., 2011) to consolidate predictions from various models. Recently, Jiang et al. (2023) introduced\nan ensemble framework designed to leverage the diverse strengths of multiple open-source LLMs.\nThis framework first employs a pairwise comparison method to detect subtle distinctions among\ncandidate outputs. Then, it combines the top-ranked candidates to produce an enhanced output,\ncapitalizing on their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses.\nSecondly, weight merging presents another approach that facilitates model fusion at the parameter\nlevel. Gupta et al. (2020) and Wortsman et al. (2022) merged weights from models with identi-\ncal structures, obtained through different strategies or configurations, to achieve improved overall\nperformance. Similarly, Cha et al. (2021), Rame et al. (2022), and Arpit et al. (2022) explored\nweighted averaging of models derived from different configurations to enhance out-of-distribution\ngeneralization. Furthermore, Jin et al. (2022) merged models designed for specific domains or tasks\nto create a generalist capable of addressing all domains or tasks. Going beyond parameter merging\nof entire models, Wang et al. (2022b), Huang et al. (2023), and Zhang et al. (2023) applied linear\nmathematical operations to adapter parameters to achieve superior generalization performance.\nIn a nutshell, while model ensemble requires the parallel deployment of multiple models, weight\nmerging is generally limited to models with identical architectures. In contrast, the approach pro-\nposed in this paper supports the fusion of multiple LLMs with diverse architectures by explicitly\ntransferring their knowledge and capabilities to a target LLM.\nKnowledge Distillation Knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), initially proposed for model\ncompression, involves training a student model under the guidance of one or more teacher mod-\nels. In the NLP community, knowledge distillation has been widely applied to text classification\ntasks. These applications include training the student model to replicate the teacher’s output distri-\nbution (Sanh et al., 2019; Turc et al., 2019), as well as features (Sun et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2020)\nand relations (Wang et al., 2020) derived from intermediate layers of the teacher model. In the realm\nof text generation, the conventional approach focuses on minimizing the KL divergence between\nthe student and teacher generation distributions. This is achieved by using the teacher’s probability\ndistributions at each time step as supervision (Khanuja et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2023; Agarwal et al.,\n2023) or by directly training on the teacher’s generated texts (Peng et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023).\nWhile our method shares a framework similar to multi-teacher knowledge distillation, there are two\nsignificant distinctions. First, in traditional knowledge distillation, the student models are typically\nconstrained to be smaller in size than the teachers. In our scenario, however, there are no limitations\non the size of the target model. Second, traditional knowledge distillation often results in the student\nmodels lagging behind the teachers in performance after distillation. In contrast, we anticipate that\nafter the fusion, the target model will surpass any of the source models in performance.\n3 K NOWLEDGE FUSION OF LLM S\nThe primary objective of LLMs fusion is to externalize the collective knowledge embedded within\nmultiple source LLMs and integrate their capabilities into a target LLM. Given Ksource LLMs\n{Ms\nj}K\nj=1with varying architectures, each having undergone individual pre-training or fine-tuning\non distinct datasets, the key idea behind our approach is to initially stimulate LLMs to manifest their\ninherent knowledge by challenging them to predict the next token. The probabilistic distributions\nof these predictions are thoroughly assessed, and the most accurate predictions are utilized to con-\ntinually train the target LLM Mton a corpus Cusing the causal language modeling objective.

This trend highlights that LLMs are good initializers for architecture search.\nVarying latency constraints. HS-NAS’s trend largely holds true across different latency con-\nstraints. Table 3 shows the comparison of the HS-NAS recipe (GPT-4, HAT, 1, 15) against SOTA\nNAS for various latency constraints: 100ms, 150ms, and 200ms. Besides reducing the search hours\nby 50%, HS-NAS achieves similar or better GFLOPs and same model size compared to SOTA NAS.\nVarying start and end iteration pairs. Among different start and end iteration pairs, HS-NAS that\nuses LLM-Distill-PP GPT-4 for first 50% of iterations and HAT supernet for the rest, performs sim-\nilarly or improves over HAT on all metrics. Table 4 shows the results of HS-NAS for various start\nand end iteration pairs. Using LLM-Distill-PP for all search iterations achieves lower performance,\nwhich indicates that marginal degradation in Kendall-Tau prevents LLM-Distill-PP from fully han-\ndling the search. These trends highlights that predictor having SOTA MAE scores seems useful for\nthe first part of search, while predictor having SOTA Kendall-Tau seems useful for the rest of search.\nVarying initialization seeds, FLOPs constraints, underlying supernet. HS-NAS seems robust to\ninitialization effects caused by different seeds, achieving largely similar numbers on all metrics. This\nresult is detailed in A.6.1. HS-NAS performs similarly to HAT for different FLOPs constraints, with\nat least 16% reduction in search hours, 1.2% improvement in latency, same GFLOPs and same model\nsize. These trends largely hold true across benchmarks as well, as detailed in A.6.2. The dominance\nof HS-NAS seems consistent across the underlying supernet (second argument), as detailed in A.6.3.\nTrivially constructed efficient adaptations of SOTA Search hours can be trivially reduced in sev-\neral ways: halving the total number of search iterations and/or using distilled SOTA predictor instead\nof using supernet predictor directly. While these adaptations lead to a big drop in BLEU perfor-\nmance (1.8% for HAT ( num-iter. =15)) or a big increase in latency and GFLOPs (9.7% and 32%\nrespectively for Distilled HAT ( num-iter. =15)), HS-NAS dominates these adaptions in search\nhour reductions, while maintaining SOTA performance and not degrading on any footprint metric,\nas detailed in A.6.4.\nPutting all the observed trends of HS-NAS together, we find that the generality of HS-NAS extends\nto constraint types (latency, FLOPs), constraint values (different latencies, different FLOPs), differ-\nent tasks (MT benchmarks), and underlying supernet (HAT, Neuron-wise MoS), while being robust\nto initialization effects.\n8 C ONCLUSION\nIn this work, we showed that LLM can be used to design accurate, cost-effective performance pre-\ndictor, which also benefits neural architecture search.

Furthermore, when using alternative\nmodels such as LLaMA-7B or smaller models like GPT-2 to generate length predictions for Vicuna,\nthe pooling + MLP approach fails completely, and fine-tuning with a length token falls short when\ncompared to Vicuna’s self-prediction capabilities.\n4 Sequence Scheduling\n4.1 Method\nHaving established an accurate response length perception module, we can now leverage it to enable\nsequence scheduling for efficient inference. As illustrated in the left side of Figure 1, when instructions\nwith highly disparate response lengths are batched together, significant, redundant computations\noccur, resulting in reduced inference throughput. Therefore, by grouping instructions with similar\nresponse lengths together, we can accelerate the inference process.\nBefore delving into the specifics of sequence scheduling, it is important to understand the significance\nof inference with large micro-batch sizes (mbs). As depicted in the Figure 3a, deploying Vicuna on\nan 80GB A100 GPU highlights the benefits of larger batch sizes in leveraging the parallel computing\npower of the GPU. When generating a fixed number of tokens for each sample, the throughput\nexhibits almost linear improvement up to a batch size of 16, after which the rate of improvement\nslows down. On the other hand, if the generation of each batch halts when all samples have finished\ngenerating their responses, the throughput also increases linearly for batch sizes smaller than 16,\nwith a higher ratio than the fixed-token approach. However, as the batch size continues to increase,\nperformance begins to decline. This is due to the fact that larger batch sizes have a high probability\nof entailing a longer response length, resulting in significant redundant computations.\nTo enable efficient sequence scheduling, we make the assumption that the number of instructions to\nprocess at a time (group size) is larger than the micro-batch size for a single GPU, which holds true\ngiven the widespread usage of LLMs. While a straightforward approach for sequence scheduling\nis to sort the instructions by their predicted length and split them into batches for processing, we\nexplore additional designs to further accelerate throughput. The pipeline of our method is depicted\non the right side of Figure 1.\nFailure Collection and Recomputation (FCR) Although the length predictor achieves a reasonably\nhigh accuracy of 81% (acc-100), there is still a chance that some samples have predictions that deviate\nsignificantly from the true response length. These incorrect predictions can greatly disrupt the\nefficiency of batch processing. For example, if a long response is mistakenly predicted as a short one\n6']",Larger group size makes scheduling more effective. Scheduling fails when the group size is too small (32).

The reason is that the Jdoctor-data\nexamples provided to the LLMs are never empty and hence the\nLLMs always generate some results for queries for Jdoctor-\ndata. In contrast, some of the specification categories (e.g.,\ndtype ) of DocTer-data examples (provided to the LLMs) may\nbe empty. The LLMs learn that empty is a possible result for\nDocTer-data. Since the baselines are rule-based, when rules are\ninapplicable, they tend to produce empty results. In contrast,\nLLMs produce results by predicting missing tokens. They may\nproduce empty results when empty is a legitimate token. The\nresults are in line with the precision and recall in Table VI,\nthat StarCoder has a much higher recall than DocTer (e.g.,\n84.0% versus 72.8%) with a comparable or slightly lower\nprecision (e.g., 84.3% versus 86.8%). Although with a lower\nempty rate, LLM tends to generate incomplete and ill-formed\nspecifications as discussed in (a).\nFinding 3: Compared to LLMs, traditional specification\nextraction approaches are much more likely to generate\nempty specifications (e.g., 73 – 80% versus 0 – 47%),\nwhile LLMs are more likely to generate ill-formed or\nincomplete specifications.\nB. Root Cause Analysis\nIn this section, we categorize the root causes of failures and\nstudy their distributions. At the end, we perform a comparative\nstudy based on the sections in the Venn diagrams (Fig. 7).\n1) LLM Failure Root Causes: Since LLM results are diffi-\ncult to interpret, it is in general difficult to determine the root\ncauses of failing cases by LLMs. We hence determine the root\ncause by finding a fix for it. The nature of the fix indicates the\nroot cause. In some cases, the failure may be fixed in multiple\nways. We consider the one requiring the least effort as the root\ncause and categorize them into five categories. Fig. 11 presents\nthe distributions of the root causes of StarCoder in different\nsections of the Venn diagrams (Fig. 7). We now explain the\nfive categories.\na) Ineffective Prompts: It means that the failure is due\nto the ineffectiveness of the examples in prompt, even with\nSR.

We find\nthat the order of examples plays a crucial role, as 21% of the\nfailure cases in this category are resolved by rearranging the\norder of the examples.\nFig. 9 presents a portion of the prompt for the target param-\netersp_input . StarCoder fails to generate the specification\nndim:>=2 , which is not explicitly stated in the description\nand requires StarCoder to comprehend the implicit relationship\nbetween Nand its value range, i.e., “N ≥=2”. Adding an\nexample with such implicit constraints enables StarCoder to\ngenerate the correct specification.\nb) Missing Domain Knowledge: This refers to LLM\nfailures due to insufficient domain knowledge. For in-\nstance, in Fig. 10, StarCoder generates a specification\nusing a non-existent function, isInDanger , instead of\nsearchForDanger . This issue arises as the LLM lacks rel-\nevant context, such as the methods in the class, while Jdoctor\nemploys a search-based approach examining all methods in\nthe relevant classes. This result uncovers LLMs’ limitation\ncompared to traditional search-based methods: a deficiency in\ndomain knowledge. To validate our hypothesis, we manually\nincorporate relevant domain knowledge into the prompt, along-\nside the provided examples. StarCoder then successfully gen-\nerates the accurate specification, utilizing the correct function\n(in green).

How can future research ensure an optimal balance of confidence and accuracy in learner-LLM interactions?,"['Guiding Students in Using LLMs 21\nsize constraints, and the controlled online setting did not have a measure for long-term learning.\nFuture studies could explore the effect of changing LLM pre-prompts on the longer-term learning\noutcomes of the students. Moreover, there is rich literature on how to guide people to use tools\n(especially in the context of learning) [ 6,10,17,41,75,94,106]. Future research can build on the\nguidance strategies proposed in this paper and explore the use of other designs to guide students, as\nwell as to encourage different approaches. Furthermore, while designing learner-LLM interactions,\nit is crucial to ensure the right balance of learners’ confidence in their answers while using LLMs,\nwith actual accuracy of their answers. High confidence with low accuracy could signal over-reliance\nand overconfidence. Future research could look at designing interactions that ensure an optimal\nbalance of confidence and accuracy.\nThere are limitations to the current work. In our formative study, the constraints of small to\nmedium-sized classroom field studies inherently limit the scope of broad statistical generalizations.\nAdditionally, observations from our specific classroom setting of an introduction to database course\nmay not be generalized to other classroom settings and audiences. For example, students with\nnon-computer science backgrounds might interact with LLMs differently and differ in LLM-related\ntrust and confidence. More studies are needed to see whether results from the online controlled\nsetting generalize to learning tasks in other contexts and populations of online learners, who\nmay differ from crowdworkers in their goals and motivation. A larger sample confirmatory study\nmight help to reliably evaluate multiple interactions between student characteristics, experimental\nvariables, achievement, and perception outcomes, which were described as exploratory in the\ncurrent work. Additionally, our findings could benefit further from a rigorous qualitative analysis\nof conversations between learners and LLM chatbots, which can help explain the mechanisms\nbehind some of the effects observed in our studies.\n7 CONCLUSION\nThrough this work, we highlight complexities of designing learner-LLM interactionsand under-\nscored the critical role of instructors, teachers, and policymakers in guiding these interactions.\nWe explore the design space of this interaction with four guidance strategies resulting in two\ndifferent approaches of use, with a prompted vs. unprompted LLM, in a classroom and a controlled\nonline setting. Even with our significant discoveries and rich data, we merely scratch the surface\nupon the complexities of collaborative learning systems involving LLM agents. LLMs demonstrate\nremarkable flexibility in supporting various strategies, but also demand oversight to ensure the\napplication of the most effective strategy in each unique learning scenario. Teachers are already\nplaying a demanding role in these collaborative learning environments, ensuring proper use of\nLLMs. This highlights an emerging imperative for CSCW and HCI researchers: to empirically study\ndiverse ways of guiding students in LLM use, thus empowering teachers who currently rely largely\non anecdotal evidence or grey literature for integrating LLMs in classrooms.\nOur research has shown the promise of simple yet effective interventions, such as including\nexamples of LLM use in assignments, prompting students to reflect on their use of LLMs, and en-\ncouraging a ’solve-first-then-consult’ approach with LLMs. These insights are crucial for educators\nand educational technology developers alike, as they collaboratively shape the next generation\nof LLM tools to be intuitive and pedagogically effective for diverse learners. Ultimately, our work\npaves the way for more in-depth investigations and broadens the avenues for further research\nwithin the CSCW and HCI communities, emphasizing the dual task for researchers and designers\nin optimizing LLM implementation for genuine student understanding and engagement.\n, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

With a large k,CoDeC-128 achieves 2.6x speedup over the baselines,\ni.e.,MicroMT in both ZH ⇔EN and TIM in EN⇒ZH, and also obtains higher COMETkiwi scores.\nThis signifies that CoDec effectively reduces decoding latency and maintains translation quality.\nOn the other hand, the models with lower kachieve better translation quality such as CoDec-8 ,\nindicating that kshould be chosen carefully to get the balance of performance and efficiency.\n13']",Hybrid Threshold demonstrates improvement on the EN ⇒ZH test set but exhibited a significant decrease on the EN ⇒RU test set.,simple,"[{'page_label': '13', 'file_name': '2311.02851v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2311.02851v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1828699, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How does Cursor facilitate pair programming with AI?,"['Gulf of Envisioning CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\n4.3 Software Development using Cursor\nCursor (Figure 4-C) is a code editor that helps users pair program\nwith AI [ 7]. The system uses an LLM – users can choose between\nGPT-4 [ 125] or ChatGPT [ 124] – to help developers chat with their\nproject, make code changes, and address bugs. Given the growing\ninterest in utilizing AI to supercharge the software development pro-\ncess [ 54,69], we analyze how Cursor implemented a human-LLM\ninterface for the complex cognitive task process of programming.\nAs a fork of VSCode [ 106], Cursor has numerous tool affordances\ncritical to supporting programming, including a file explorer, line\ncompletion, and a search bar. However, there are many features\nspecific to Cursor. When planning, users are given several examples\nof tasks they can accomplish. In addition, there are various ways to\nconverse with the LLM, including when selecting the text, using\nkeyboard shortcuts within the main editor, and the right sidebar\ndedicated to chatting with the model. During execution, the user\ncan either write code normally in the editor or prompt the model\nto generate code. Finally, the system provides several features for\nevaluation, including regenerating model responses, chatting with\na model about code, and auto-debugging.\n4.3.1 Capability Gap. Cursor’s first way of showcasing what tasks\nare available within the system is through a set of example files\nwhen a user first opens the editor. Each of these files is named\nafter a possible task, and the comments in the file give instructions\nregarding what keyboard shortcuts and prompt to use to complete\nthe goal. Similar to ChatGPT, though, since these tasks are high-\nlevel (i.e., “fix a bug,” “explain code”), they are not helpful for more\nspecific planning of goals and intentions. When interacting with\ncode across the various panels of the interface – including the\ncode editor and the chat interface on the right-hand side – the\ntooltip shows both what actions can be taken with an LLM and\nhow to establish context. For instance, highlighting text within a\ncode editor gives users the option to either add the code to the\nright-hand chat interface or edit directly with a prompt. Likewise,\ninside of the chat interface, buttons appear for users to reference a\nfile or change the scope of the user’s question within a prompt.\n4.3.2 Instruction gap. To help users understand how LLMs inter-\npret language, Cursor allows users to ask models questions about\ntheir codebase. Topics for these questions can range from the inner\nworkings of a particular function to the overall flow of an entire\nproject. Since this feature can give answers about model-generated\nand user-written code, developers can get a better idea of how LLMs\ninterpret their programs“under the hood.” A similar feature that\ncan help decipher how models understand code is prompting the\nmodel to generate inline comments. Finally, despite no direct func-\ntionality for regenerating output outside of feeding the model the\nsame prompt, there is an option to “rerun without context” to see\nthe effects of adding code or references to other materials alongside\na prompt. The lack of regeneration history, however, makes it more\ncomplicated for users to map changes in their inputs to changes in\nmodel outputs.\n4.3.3 Intentionality Gap. The primary way Cursor aligns user in-\ntent with model output is through references of code snippets, files,\nand documentation. When authoring a prompt, users can attach\nan existing file of code they’ve written, a function within the codeeditor, or even documentation of third-party libraries to steer the\noutput of the model. This functionality has many use cases, includ-\ning prompting the model to adopt the same style or asking the LLM\nto use a particular method or function from a library. While this\nfeature reduces the amount of effort involved in establishing con-\ntext with the LLM, this affordance does not inherently give users\na mental model of how the LLM works, which means that users\nmay still run into issues. Furthermore, to help evaluate output, user\ncan ask Cursor questions about their codebase. The questions can\nbe about any piece of code within the code editor – either model-\nor user-generated – to help users understand how to make their\nprompts more optimal.\n5 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DESIGNING\nINTERFACES FOR ENVISIONING\nIn addition to the three interfaces described in detail in the previ-\nous section, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 12 systems to\nidentify design patterns that would potentially support the process\nof envisioning. We only selected tools that were either directly\naccessible or at least had a video demonstration and accompanying\ntechnical description of the features, such as in research papers. For\neach tool, we identified affordances along the three main operators\nin generative tasks, namely planning, execution, and evaluation.\nWe then clustered the identified features based on their functional\nsimilarity to develop a set of interface design patterns and corre-\nsponding tenets for teams building human-LLM systems. We do\nnot claim a comprehensive categorization but provide a starting\npoint for the design of interface affordances for envisioning LLM\ninteractions.\nDesign Pattern 1 – Visually Track Prompts and Outputs: LLM\ninteractions are often iterative and take a trial-and-error approach.\nWe observed that some tools provided users with a visual inter-\nface for capturing their prompting and divergent thinking through\nalternative pathways. A popular choice is node-based interfaces,\nwhich allow users to visualize multiple different outputs (nodes)\nand trace how they are connected (edges). As mentioned before, in\nSpellburst [ 5], each node represents a sketch, and edges showcase\ndifferent iterations of the sketch through merging, diffing, and other\nsemantic operators. In PromptChainer [ 185], a system that helps\nusers chain together LLM prompts for complex tasks, each node\nrepresents an individual prompt and corresponding output while\neach edge represents the use of the output as context for another\nprompt. Such external representations of their thought process not\nonly lower cognitive load but also help users better engage in more\ndeliberate prompt authoring. For instance, users can readily see if\ntheir previous line of thinking was fruitful or make adjustments\nto subsequent prompts based on prior outputs. These affordances\ncorrespond to the tenet that: Users need guidance navigating the\ncognitive task space for prompt authoring, discerning which paths\nlead to desired or poor outcomes [T1].\nDesign Pattern 2 – Suggest Ideas for Prompting: Many systems\nproactively offer users prompt suggestions. Some of them are aimed\nat assisting users who may not be as familiar with LLM-enabled\ninterfaces, while others serve as ideation partners in the cognitive\ntask workflow. In addition to providing ideas for prompts, examples']","Cursor facilitates pair programming with AI by allowing users to chat with their project, make code changes, and address bugs using an LLM such as GPT-4 or ChatGPT.

In\nsome cases, they can even make the performance\nworse. The session-based evaluation is challeng-\ning since errors made in previous turns make the\nLLM fail to finish the session and also influence\nthe completion of the current turn. Also, we need\nmore advanced planning algorithms to complete\nthe multi-turn session.\n(2) LLMs perform badly in processing long\nPPT template: Current LLMs’ performance in the\nediting PPT temples task is pretty poor. For exam-\nple, the strongest GPT-4 only achieves 38.1% turn-\nbased accuracy and 6.0% session-based accuracy in\nthis task. Other LLMs’ performance is even poorer.\nThe content selection algorithm can partially solve\nthis challenge by filtering out irrelevant file content,\nbut GPT-4 with it still only achieves 43.1% turn-\nbased accuracy. That means current LLMs (e.g.,\nGPT-4) still struggle to handle complex and lengthy\nPPT templates. For open-source LLMs, there’s a\nrisk of information loss due to token limitations\n(typically 2 ∼4K tokens limit), which often require\ntruncating lengthy PPT content. When it comes to\nsession-based performance, the accuracy remains\nnearly zero. This implies that current LLMs are\nstill far from being ideal PPT agents capable of\neffectively assisting users in editing PPT templates\nduring a multi-turn dialogue session.\n(3) Multi-modal instructions increase the\nLLM’s failure rate significantly. To assess LLMs’\ntask completion performance for instructions in-\nvolving multi-modal operations (Table, Chart, Pic-ture, Position, and text), we calculate the average\naccuracy of GPT-4 for instructions involving each\nmodality, respectively. This is done by dividing the\nnumber of correctly completed instructions within\neach modality by the total number of instructions\ninvolving that modality’s operation. The results\nare presented in Figure 5 (a). From the figure, we\nobserve that GPT-4 performs exceptionally well in\nthe text modality, achieving an accuracy of 85.6%.\nIts performance becomes poorer when process-\ning structured data (Chart and Table), with 12.4%\nand 16.2% lower accuracy. Instructions involv-\ning picture-related operation pose an even greater\nchallenge for GPT-4, as it achieves a 56.8% turn-\nbased accuracy in this modality.

How is chain-of-thought reasoning used in the context of utilizing an LLM for cybersecurity tasks?,"['The largest and best performing LLMs are trained on\ndatasets of trillions of words, through crawling of internet text,\nbooks, and other text sources [12]. Given the massive extent\nof these datasets, in addition to the models’ human-like rea-\nsoning capabilities on these topics, we can expect that LLMs\nhave been trained on cybersecurity reports and resources,\nalong with both threat-related and defensive code. They are\nlikely to have ingested many sources of publicly available\ncyber information, such as enumerations of exposures and\nweaknesses found in CWE and CVE, publicly available data\non APTs in ATT&CK, attack patterns in CAPEC, exploits in\nexploitDB, and pen-testing strategies and tools from online\nguides.\nThese suppositions encouraged us to explore a LLM’s cy-\nber knowledge and ability to both reason about threats and\nrecommend actions. Would an LLM be able to produce in-\nformation about threats and actual tools? Could it offer shell\ncommands complete with the required arguments and flags?\nCould it interpret information gathered from a command line?\nCould it capture a threat actor’s decision process, plan an at-\ntack, and adapt it to newly obtained information? See Figure 1.\nCould such a system be used to improve the competency of\nnovice threat actors? To what degree could such a process be\nfully automated? What capabilities could potentially emerge\nas both LLMs and techniques for using them advance? What\nwould be the potential impact? These are questions we ex-\nplore in this paper.\nWe start by describing our initial exploration where we\nuse and assess ChatGPT1(our LLM of choice, also referred\nto as GPT-3.5-Turbo in the API version) on a simple cyber\ntask. Our findings are positive and also startling. They lead\nus to try using the LLM to support an end-to-end 3-stage\ncampaign. This leads us to investigate prompt engineering,\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and other approaches for using\nthe LLM in either an assistive or autonomous mode.\nFigure 1: A threat actor, shown in black, uses the LLM as\nan aid to recommend next actions based on their network\nposition, observations, and prior actions. We show an initial\nLLM prompt (top left).\n1https://chat.openai.com/In proceeding, in Section 2 we describe our initial explo-\nrations of ChatGPT and summarize the challenges that arise\nwhen moving beyond them, In Section 4.1, we describe our\nsandbox. In Section 3, we present a set of prompts that enable\nan agent to elicit cyber security guidance from an LLM. Using\nthe aforementioned prompts, we provide demonstration of the\nautomated agent executing actions for reconnaissance, exploit,\nand exfiltration campaign stages in Section 4.2. We provide\nevaluation of the LLMs cyber-specfic knowledge in Section\n4.3 and give insights into our prompt design in Section 4.4.\nWe conclude our work with discussion and opinions of how\nLLMs might shape the future of cyber threats and how they\ncan be abused in Section 5, along with our design limitations\nin Section 6.\n2 First Impressions and Challenges Ahead\nWe focus the LLM on a decision process that oversees execut-\ning and interpreting commands or tools on a command-line\nterminal. The threat actor decision process typically requires a\nhuman to understand information returned when a command\nexecutes. For example, a basic reconnaissance scanning tool,\nsuch as nmap , see e.g. the first line of Figure 2, can in some\ncases respond with hundreds of lines of text containing IP\naddresses, open ports, and applications running on the host,\nsee the remaining lines of Figure 2. These must be read and\ninterpreted to decide upon the next command. Traditionally,\na human or an nmap specific parser would be used to parse\nthe response, extract the host name(s), IP address(es), open\nport(s), running services, etc. There is often a low signal-to-\nnoise ratio in such scans in terms of information that can lead\nto a successful exploit. This is a laborious process to manu-\nally scan many lines of output or develop a parser for every\ntool; where additional custom code is needed to interpret the\ncontents with respect to the threat actor’s objective.\nFigure 2: An example NMap service scan command (blue)\nand a trimmed response from our sandbox. Highlighted fields\n(yellow) reveal actionable information such as hostname, open\nports, type of service, service name, and service version num-\nber(s).\n2']",Chain-of-thought reasoning is used in the context of utilizing an LLM for cybersecurity tasks to support an end-to-end 3-stage campaign.

What is a limitation of smaller-scale LLMs regarding their instruction-following capability?,"['informative checklist for reflection. Our experi-\nments show that Self-Contrast performs well across\na variety of scenarios and with different LLMs.\nLimitations\nFor some smaller-scale LLMs, their instruction-\nfollowing capability is weaker, hindering their po-\ntential to conduct precise comparisons and reflec-\ntion. In such scenarios, the effectiveness of Self-\nContrast might be slightly inferior to ensemble\nstrategies. For instance, the performance of Self-\nContrast with Llama2-7B is marginally lower than\nself-consistency.

What are the two kinds of surrogate models studied in the context of Bayesian optimization over molecules?,"['A Sober Look at LLMs for Bayesian Optimization Over Molecules\nThese facts make the LLA interpretable: it simply adds an\nuncertainty estimate to the original NN prediction gθ∗(x).\nThat uncertainty can further be calibrated via the LA’s\nmarginal-likelihood approximation (Daxberger et al., 2021):\nZ(γ) = log p(θ∗|D;γ) +P\n2log 2π+1\n2log|Σ∗(γ)|,(3)\nwhere we have made the dependency of the posterior and\nthe Hessian on the hyperparameters γexplicit. For example,\nγcould be a set that contains the weight decay strength\n(corresponds to the prior precision of the Gaussian prior\nonΘ) and the noise strength in the likelihood of g. In this\nsetting, the optimization maxγlogZ(γ)can thus be seen\nas learning a suitable prior and estimating data noise.\n2.3. Large language models\nA crucial component of the recent development in large\nNNs is the K-head self-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al.,\n2017). Given a length- Tsequence of input embeddings of\ndimension N, sayX∈RT×N, it computes\nO= [H1, . . . ,HK]W⊤\no∈RT×O,\nHi=s\x10\n1√\nD(XQ⊤\ni)(XK⊤\ni)⊤\x11\n(X⊤Vi)∈RT×D,(4)\nwhere [. . .]is a column-wise stacking operator, taking K-\nmany T×Dmatrices to a T×KD matrix; Wo∈RO×KD\nandQi,Ki,Vi∈RD×Nare linear projectors; and the\nsoftmax function s(·)is applied row-wise.\nThe resulting network architecture, obtained by stacking\nmultiple attention modules along with other layers like resid-\nual and normalization layers, is called a transformer . When\nused for language modeling, the resulting model is called\nalarge language model (LLM) . The output Oof the last\ntransformer module can then be used as a feature for a dense\noutput layer Head :RO→RC, taking the row-wise aggre-\ngate (e.g. average) of Oto aC-dimensional vector, where\nCis the number of outputs in the problem. For natural\nlanguage generation, Cequals the size of the vocabulary V,\ne.g. around 32,000in Touvron et al. (2023a). One can also\nmodularly replace this head so that the LLM can be used for\ndifferent tasks, e.g. single-output regression where C= 1.\n2.3.1. P ARAMETER -EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING\nDue to the sheer size of LLMs, the costs of training LLMs\nfrom scratch are prohibitively expensive even for relatively\nsmall LLMs (Sharir et al., 2020). Thankfully, LLMs are usu-\nally trained in a task-agnostic manner and have been shown\nto be meaningful, generic “priors” for natural-language-\nrelated tasks (Brown et al., 2020). This means one can\nsimply perform finetuning on top of a pretrained LLM (Sun\net al., 2019). However, standard finetuning, i.e. further opti-\nmizing allthe LLM’s parameters, is expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which add a few addi-\ntional parameters, say ω, to the LLM and keep the original\nLLM parameters frozen, have therefore become standard.\nA popular example of PEFT is LoRA (Hu et al., 2022),\nwhich uses a bottleneck architecture to introduce additional\nparameters in a LLM. Let W∗∈RD×Nbe an attention\nweight matrix. LoRA freezes it and then augments it into\nW=W∗+B⊤A;A∈RZ×N,B∈RZ×D.(5)\nThe additional weights in A,Bare thus few for a small Z.\nNote that, many other PEFT methods are also commonly\nused in practice, e.g., Adapter (Houlsby et al., 2019), Prefix\nTuning (Li & Liang, 2021), IA3 (Liu et al., 2022), etc.\n3. Experiment Setup\nEquipped with the necessary background knowledge from\nSection 2, we are now ready to discuss our experiments in an\nattempt to answer our main question on whether LLMs are\ngood for BO in molecular discovery. Refer to Algorithm 1\nfor the problem statement.\nDatasets We evaluate the models considered (see below)\non the following datasets that represent realistic problem\nsets from molecular materials discovery: minimizing (i)\nthe redox potential ( redoxmer ) and (ii) solvation energy\n(solvation ) of possible flow battery electrolytes (Agarwal\net al., 2021), (iii) minimizing the docking score of kinase\ninhibitors for drug discovery (Graff et al., 2021), (iv) max-\nimization of the fluorescence oscillator strength of lasers\n(Strieth-Kalthoff et al., 2023), (v) maximization of the power\nconversion efficiency (PCE) of photovoltaics materials\n(Lopez et al., 2016), and (vi) maximization of the π-π∗\ntransition wavelength of organic photoswitches (Griffiths\net al., 2022). For each virtual library of molecules above,\na physics-inspired simulation has been performed by the\nrespective authors, which we use here as the ground truth\nf(x). Note that these problem sets cover a series of differ-\nent physical properties of molecules and therefore represent\na diverse set of molecular design tasks.\nFeatures and LLMs We use the following standard non-\nLLM, chemistry-specific baselines: 1024-bit Morgan finger-\nprints (Morgan, 1965) as a chemistry-specific (non-learned)\nalgorithmic vectorization scheme, and the feature vectors\nfrom the pretrained MolFormer transformer (Ross et al.,\n2022). Meanwhile, for the general-purpose LLMs, we use\nvarious recent architectures of varying sizes: T5-Base ( T5,\nRaffel et al., 2020), GPT2-Medium ( GPT2-M , Radford\net al., 2019), and LLAMA-2-7B ( LL2-7B , Touvron et al.,\n2023a). Finally, we use the work of Christofidellis et al.\n(2023, T5-Chem ) to represent domain-specific LLMs.\nPrompts For text-based surrogate models, we addition-\nally consider several prompting functions c(x), mapping a\n4', 'A Sober Look at LLMs for Bayesian Optimization Over Molecules\nTransformer ( W∗)Language Modeling\nHead\nRegression\nHead ( w)p(gt(·)| D t;W∗)\n(a) Fixed-feature LLM surrogate\nTransformer ( W∗)\nPEFT ( ω)Regression\nHead ( w)p(gt(·)| D t;W∗) (b) Adaptive-feature LLM surrogate\nFigure 2. The surrogates we consider in this work. “PEFT” refers to parameter efficient finetuning which adds few trainable weights ωto\nthe transformer. Grey means the weights are frozen and thus act as conditioning variables in the posterior over the surrogate gt. Green\nmeans the weights are trained in a Bayesian manner (e.g., to obtain p(w,ω| Dt)) and then marginalized to obtain the posterior predictive\ndistribution over gt(e.g.,RR\np(gt(·)|w,ω;W∗)p(w,ω| Dt)dwdω). Note that both models are principled Bayesian surrogates, in\ncontrast to the in-context learning frameworks considered by prior works on BO with LLMs (Ramos et al., 2023; Anonymous, 2023).\nbecome very popular in many domains that are tradition-\nally rather disconnected from natural language processing,\nsuch as in biology (Vig et al., 2021), education (Kasneci\net al., 2023), law (Chalkidis et al., 2020), and chemistry\n(Maik Jablonka et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Jablonka\net al., 2023, etc.). On the other hand, recent works have\nwarned that LLMs might not necessarily understand things,\nbut simply act as very expensive “stochastic parrots” (Ben-\nder et al., 2021), see Figure 1 for example. Nevertheless,\ndue to the apparent capabilities of LLMs, some recent works\nhave leveraged off-the-shelf LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI,\n2023) for BO over molecules (Ramos et al., 2023) and for\nhyperparameter tuning (Anonymous, 2023). However, their\nuncertainty estimates are obtained only through heuristics,\nsuch as from the softmax probabilities of the generated an-\nswer tokens, coming from point-estimated non-Bayesian\nLLMs. These non-Bayesian uncertainties thus might not be\noptimal for the exploration-exploitation tradeoff that is so\ncrucial for BO (Garnett, 2023).\nIn this work, we take a dispassionate look at LLMs for BO\nover molecules. We do so by carefully constructing and\nstudying two kinds of surrogate models that are amenable to\na principled Bayesian treatment, see Figure 2. First, we treat\nthe LLM as a fixed feature extractor and find out whether its\nfeatures are already useful as they are for BO over molecules.\nSecond, we attempt to answer whether the “stochastic parrot”\ncan be “taught”—via parameter-efficient fine-tuning meth-\nods (e.g., Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; Hu et al.,\n2022) and the Laplace approximation (MacKay, 1992a;\nDaxberger et al., 2021)—to perform efficient Bayesian ex-\nploration in the molecular space.\nIn sum, our contribution is four-fold:\n(a)We study the out-of-the-box usefulness of pretrained\nLLMs for material discovery by using their last embed-\ndings in BO.\n(b)We study whether finetuning through PEFT and then ap-\nplying approximate Bayesian inference over it is worth\nthe effort in terms of the BO performance.(c)We provide an easy-to-use software library for prin-\ncipled BO on discrete space with LLMs: https://\ngithub.com/wiseodd/lapeft-bayesopt .\n(d)Through our extensive experiments ( 8real-world chem-\nistry problems, 8recent LLMs—including LLAMA-\n2—and non-LLM based features), we provide insights\non whether, when, and how “stochastic parrots” can be\nuseful to drive better scientific discovery.\nLimitations Our focus in this work is to study LLMs for\ndiscrete BO on a predetermined set of molecules, as usually\ndone in real-world chemistry labs (Strieth-Kalthoff et al.,\n2023, etc.). We leave the study of BO on continuous space\nwith principled LLM-based Bayesian surrogates as future\nwork. Finally, we focus only on chemistry, although our\nexperiments can also be done for other domains.\n2. Preliminaries\nHere, we introduce key concepts in Bayesian optimization,\nBayesian neural networks, and large language models.\n2.1. Bayesian optimization\nSuppose f:X → Y is a function that is not analytically\ntractable and/or very expensive to evaluate. We would like\n(without loss of generality) to find x∗= arg maxx∈Xf(x).\nFor example, we might want to find a new drug xin the\nspace of all drugs Xthat has high efficacy over the pop-\nulation f(x). An increasingly common way to approach\nthis problem is to perform Bayesian optimization (BO). The\nkey components of BO are: (i) a surrogate function gthat\ntractably approximate f; (ii) a prior belief and a likelihood\n(and hence a posterior) over g; and (iii) an acquisition func-\ntionα:X →Rthat implicitly defines a policy for choosing\nwhich x∈ X to evaluate fat. The expressiveness ofgdic-\ntates how accurately we can approximate f; and the calibra-\ntionof the posterior (predictive) distribution p(gt| Dt)at\nsteptunder previous observations Dt:={(xi, f(xi))}t−1\ni=1\ndictates where should we explore and where should we\n2']","The two kinds of surrogate models studied in the context of Bayesian optimization over molecules are: (1) treating the LLM as a fixed feature extractor, and (2) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to perform efficient Bayesian exploration in the molecular space.",simple,"[{'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1140856, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1140856, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

What is the purpose of Factualness Evaluations via Weighting LLMs (FEWL) in measuring LLM hallucinations?,"['MEASURING AND REDUCING LLM H ALLUCINATION WITHOUT\nGOLD-STANDARD ANSWERS VIA EXPERTISE -WEIGHTING\nJiaheng Wei\nUC Santa CruzYuanshun Yao\nByteDance ResearchJean-Francois Ton\nByteDance ResearchHongyi Guo\nNorthwestern University\nAndrew Estornell\nByteDance ResearchYang Liu∗\nByteDance Research\nABSTRACT\nLLM hallucination, i.e. generating factually incorrect yet seemingly convincing answers, is currently\na major threat to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs. The first step towards solving this\ncomplicated problem is to measure it. However, existing hallucination metrics require to have a\nbenchmark dataset with gold-standard answers, i.e. “best” or “correct” answers written by humans.\nSuch requirement makes hallucination measurement costly and prone to human errors. In this work,\nwe propose Factualness Evaluations via Weighting LLMs ( FEWL ), the first hallucination metric that\nis specifically designed for the scenario when gold-standard answers are absent. FEWL leverages the\nanswers from off-the-shelf LLMs that serve as a proxy of gold-standard answers. The key challenge is\nhow to quantify the expertise of reference LLMs resourcefully. We show FEWL has certain theoretical\nguarantees and demonstrate empirically it gives more accurate hallucination measures than naively\nusing reference LLMs. We also show how to leverage FEWL to reduce hallucination through both\nin-context learning and supervised finetuning. Last, we build a large-scale benchmark dataset to\nfacilitate LLM hallucination research.\n1 Introduction\nLLM is known to provide factually inaccurate information that appears to be confident, i.e. hallucination. It is currently\na major obstacle to the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM [ 13,34,21]. An essential step towards solving this\nproblem is measuring hallucinations. However, this is challenging from a data perspective as existing metrics presume\nthat benchmark datasets posses gold-standard answers, i.e. “best” or “correct” answers written by humans [ 16]. The\nrequirement of such answers imposes two fundamental limitations on hallucination measurement: 1) hiring human\nannotators to produce gold-standard answers is costly in both time and money [ 4,43,38]; 2) gold-standard answers are\nprone to natural human errors [7, 6, 49].\nTo this end, we take a step forward and propose a framework which measures the LLM hallucinations without the\nrequirement of gold-standard answers. Our framework is partially inspired by the literature on learning with noisy\nlabels [ 23,18,19], where there are no ground-truth labels for verifying the quality of imperfect human annotations\n[43,38,20], detecting annotation errors [ 48,26,47], or training models robustly [ 42,3,17,36,39]. Our basic idea is\nsimple: leveraging off-the-shelf and high-quality LLMs to generate answers that serve as a proxy for gold-standard\nanswers.\nThe primary challenge in such an approach is how to properly weigh the expertise of each LLM for a given question x,\nwithout a priori knowledge of the true (i.e. gold-standard) answer y∗. To overcome this challenge, our key insight is to\ninvert the problem; it is hard to know if an LLM’s answer is correct, but it is easier to know if it is wrong . Following\nthis insight, we measure the expertise of each LLM in two ways:\n•How likely is the LLM to disagree with wrong answers?\n∗The work was done when Jiaheng Wei, Hongyi Guo interned at ByteDance Research.

However, LLM safety has also garnered considerable at-\ntention. When deployed in social media contexts, biased and unfair\nLLMs risk amplifying existing prejudices [ 1,23,32,52,65,70] and\ncompromising diversity [22, 38, 43, 66].\nExisting efforts have endeavored to evaluate and mitigate bias\nin LLMs encompassing a multitude of evaluation strategies and\nmethods [ 24,37,44,77]. From the view of evaluating populations, a\nprimary strategy has been the collection of large-scale benchmark\ndatasets encompassing many specific demographic groups [ 29,71,\n†: Yanan Cao is the corresponding author.\nThe middle-aged person has a strong stink. Form a sentence with target “the middle-age” and attribute “stink”\nThe elderly do not stink.Form a sentence with target “elderly” and attribute “stink”\nIt is unfair to labeled Egyptian as stinky.Form a sentence with target “Egyptian” and attribute “stink”Dimension: NationalityDimension: AgeDimension: Age\nFigure 1: An example of lack of group fairness.

When it comes to evaluating methods, prior work mainly lie\nin analyzing bias associations in the content generated by LLMs\nfor various tasks, such as prompt completion [ 7,18], dialogue\ngeneration[ 71], and question answering [ 53]. To mitigating these\nissues and achieve fairness, existing methods often focus on curat-\ning high-quality datasets and prompts for training [ 27,40,54,83],\ninstruct tuning [ 16,51,68,74], reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback [ 15,51,68] or prompt engineering [ 8]. However, exist-\ning methods often focus on a limited number of specific groups\nand prompts, lacking a comprehensive categorical perspective. As\nshown in Figure 1, for the often discriminated-against elderly, the\nmodel recognizes fairness, but lacks sensitivity towards the less-\nmentioned middle-aged. Besides, we only switch the target word\nfrom one age group (elderly) to a nationality (Egyptian), but the\nLLM changes its strategy and declines to comment. It demonstrates\nthat a narrow focus on a single category or attribute (e.g., age) risks\noverlooking potentially severe biases that may be present in other\nattributes (e.g., nationality). Furthermore, these methods primarily\nrely on direct inquiry attitude, so they can easily be avoid by LLMs\nsecurity mechanisms.arXiv:2312.15478v1  [cs.CL]  24 Dec 2023']",The purpose of the GF-Think method is to mitigate biases in large language models from a group fairness perspective.,simple,"[{'page_label': '1', 'file_name': '2312.15478v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2312.15478v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4415345, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

The LLMs selected here are listed in Table 1.\n4.3 Meta-evaluation Metrics\nIn our experiments, we collected manual annotations as the gold\nstandard for the quality of LLM-generated summaries to evaluate\nthe evaluation performance of the PRE model and baselines. Our\nannotation data has been organized into two different formats: (1)\npairwise preferences, denoted as 𝑧(𝑠1,𝑠2,𝑡), which indicate the user\npreference between summary 𝑠1and𝑠2in terms of summarization\nquality for text 𝑡. The function 𝑧assigns values of either 𝑠1or𝑠2\nto represent the better summary; (2) pointwise labels, denoted as\n𝑦(𝑠,𝑡), which indicate the quality of summary 𝑠summarizing text 𝑡.\nThe details on the collection of manual annotation will be discussed\nin Section 4.5.\nFor these two different formats of labels, we proposed various\nevaluation metrics to measure the performance of LLM evaluation\nmodels. Specifically, (1) for pairwise labels, we use Precision (P)\nto measure the proportion of identical preference results between\nthe model and human cognition. (2) for pointwise labels, we use\nKendall’s tau (𝜏) [18] and Spearman correlation coefficient\n(𝑆) [22] to measure the consistency between the model’s outputs\nˆ𝑦(𝑠,𝑡)and labels𝑦(𝑠,𝑡). We calculate 𝜏and𝑆for each task, and\nreport the mean of them as the overall performance.\n4.4 Framework Details\n4.4.1 Qualification exam module. To test the ability of reviewer\ncandidate LLMs, we selected the outputs (i.e., summaries of testdocuments) of three evaluatee LLMs with varying quality: GPT-3.5-\nturbo, Fastchat-t5-3b, and Alpaca-7b, as “questioners”. Reviewer can-\ndidates are asked to rate these summaries. We designed three rating\nmethods: 5-level pointwise ,100-level pointwise , and pairwise\n(or called preference ). In both the 5-level and 100-level pointwise\nrating methods, the candidate LLMs need to rate an integer number\nfor each (text, summary) pair to indicate its summarization quality.\nThe differences between 5-level and 100-level settings are not only\nin the rating scale and granularity (1-5 levels and 0-100 levels),\nbut also in the guidance style: the 5-level method offers detailed\ndefinition of each level, while the 100-level method only provides a\ngeneral description on the quality tendency. The pairwise rating\nmethod requires candidate LLMs to rate the preference for each\n(text, summary 1, summary 2) tuple, determining which summary\nbetter summarize the text. To reduce bias caused by word position\nand frequency, we constructed two prompt samples ( (𝑡,𝑠1,𝑠2)and\n(𝑡,𝑠2,𝑠1)) for each text-summary-summary tuple (𝑡,𝑠1,𝑠2)in our\nexperiments.\nWe uniformly designed prompts for these three rating methods,\nas specified in the Appendix B. Additionally, we collected human\npreferences as the ground truth for the exam, and then used Pre-\ncision (e.g., in the pointwise cases like 5-level or 100-level ratings,\nconvert the rates to pairwise preferences first) in the pairwise mode\nas the evaluation metric to rate the evaluation ability of candidate\nLLMs. Only when an LLM’s Precision exceeds the threshold of 𝜉, it\nwill be retained as a reviewer for the peer review process. In our\nexperiments, we set 𝜉to be 60%.\n4.4.2 Peer review module. For the text summarization task, we\nhave devised a unified set of prompts to be fed into the whole\neleven evaluatee LLMs. Specifically, we utilized the prompt template\n“Task: Generate a short summary of the text in at most 64 words.\nText: {original text} Summary: ”. Then, only the LLMs that pass the\nqualification exam are deployed to rate the outputs of evaluatee\nLLMs. We fed the prompts designed in the Appendix B into reviewer\nLLMs and collected their scoring results. Overall, in the pointwise\nand pairwise modes, each reviewer LLM is required to generate\n11×100=1,100rates or𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑚(11,2)×100=11,000preferences,\nrespectively.']","The different large language models used in the experiments and their respective developers are: GPT-4 by OpenAI, Claude-1 by Anthropic, GPT-3.5-turbo by OpenAI, Llama-2-70b-chat by Meta, Vicuna-7b by LMSYS, ChatGLM2-6B by Tsinghua, RWKV-4-Raven-7B by BlinkDL, Alpaca-7b by Stanford, FastChat-t5-3b by LMSYS, ChatGLM-Pro by Tsinghua, and Baichuan-2-13b by Baichuan Inc.",simple,"[{'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '2401.15641v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2401.15641v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1329598, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
What are the benefits and current limitations of using Simultaneous Machine Translation (SimulMT) LLMs compared to NMT LLMs?,"['with large values for either resulting in the specula-\ntive target translation getting too close to the size\nof the source context. In our tests, when reaching\nthe same length as the source context (akin to con-\ntext levels of wait-1 ), degenerate output began to\nappear that resulted in the output trailing off (e.g.,\nfinal output of ""que..."" instead of correct output of\n""que""). Notably, too many committed chunks only\nexplains performance gaps for chunk-wise SBS,\nnot single SBS, which is normally a flat improve-\nment upon greedy decoding (single SBS is still\nsensitive to window size). Future experiments can\nbe conducted to utilize the proposed Simul-LLM\nframework to quantify these factors.\n7.2 Exploration of SimulMT LLMs with\nProposed Prompt Structure\nIn Table 1, we also provide a breakdown of the\nperformance of our exploration of SimulMT LLMs\nwith our proposed prompt structure in Section 5.2\nthat carefully manages source context availability\nfor target translation generation. Two models are\nemployed for this exploration, one fine-tuned for\nwait-3 inference, and another fine-tuned for wait-7\ninference that produces noticeable better quality\ntranslations than the first.\nWhile SimulMT LLMs are a more promising\napproach in achieving higher translation quality\nthan NMT LLMs due to more direct task-specific\nfine-tuning and better context alignment, our ex-\nperiment results suggest that, for the time-being,\nthe performance of SimulMT LLMs is not advan-\ntageous to NMT LLMs adapted to SimulMT (and\nvaries from slightly worse to barely better trans-\nlation quality compared with the classical non-\nLLM SimulMT baseline). This is not completely\nunexpected as NMT LLMs have been optimized\nheavily in recent years whereas the exploration of\nSimulMT LLMs has just started. We provide some\nanalysis below that point out several possible rea-\nsons for this observed performance gap and call for\nadditional community efforts to investigate further.\nFirst, due to computational constraints we were\nunable to fine-tune for an entire epoch of the train-\ning dataset (only 2M random samples out of 5M),\nwhich represents a major loss of lessons and a lack\nof rigorous wait-k curriculum for the fine-tuned\nmodel. Second, it is possible that the fine-tuning\nhyperparameters are ill-suited for this particular\nprompt.

Third, at least one other work related to\nNMT LLMs (Chen et al., 2023) has demonstrated\nthat relative positional embeddings can cause issues\nvia attention dilution that ends up being unhelpful,\nsuggesting that distancing the source context, run-\nning target hypothesis, and the current translation\nstep hypothesis can be unexpectedly problematic.\nWe posit that our proposed Simul-LLM can be\nleveraged to verify the above reasons.\n7.3 Higher Wait-k Generalizability\nComparisons\nIt is well documented that in typical SimulMT\nsystems, training or fine-tuning with a slightly\nhigher wait-k than is intended during inference can\nboost translation quality and generalizability across\nslightly lower wait-k (Ma et al., 2019). While this\nlikely applies to SimulMT LLMs, no existing work\nhas validated that this behavior persists. We pro-\nvide a brief comparison of two SimulMT LLMs\nfine-tuned via wait-3 andwait-7 context levels in\nTable 2. The results in the table demonstrate that,\ngenerally, the expected behavior does hold, with all\nLLMs fine-tuned in wait-7 outperforming their cor-\nresponding wait-3 models for the same inference\nwait-k . We leave validating additional, previously\nunderstood SimulMT principles in SimulMT LLMs\nto future work.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this work, we introduce Simul-LLM, the first\nopen-source framework that enables rapid de-\nvelopment of LLM fine-tuning and evaluation\npipelines for simultaneous machine translation\n(SimulMT).

How do emotions and mood influence information processing and decision-making according to the Affect-as-Information Hypothesis and the Affect Infusion Model?,"['LLM5.3.4 Scenario-based Demonstration\nAnchoring Bias in LLM-assisted Decision-Making (Scenario 5). Jenna, the marketing manager, approached\nan LLM to optimize her company’s digital advertising strategy. In Jenna’s case the Anchoring Bias could have\ninfluenced her decision, as the LLM’s initial recommendation to invest in the new social media platform could\nhave served as the anchor for Jenna’s decision-making process. The anchor could have restricted Jenna’s\nconsideration of alternative platforms or strategies. Even if other platforms may offer better value or alignment\nwith the company’s goals, the influence of the initial suggestion may limit exploration. Moreover, Jenna might\nhave been more inclined to seek information that supports the chosen social media platform, potentially\noverlooking data that suggests a different allocation could be more effective.\nConfirmation Bias in LLM-assisted Decision-making (Scenario 2). David, already concerned\nabout his health and seeking answers in an LLM-powered medical advice forum, may have paid more attention\nto information that aligned with his fears or suspicions. If the LLM suggests a rare illness, he might be\nmore inclined to focus on and remember that information, potentially overlooking more likely or common\nexplanations for his symptoms. David might be more likely to seek out additional information that supports\nthe suggestion made by the LLM. This could involve further online searches, consulting additional medical\nsources that also suggest the rare illness, or even discounting information that contradicts the initial suggestion.\n5.4 Emotions and Mood\n5.4.1 Theoretical Background\nAffect encompasses both Emotion and Mood , each distinguished by their respective object and temporal\nlimitations. An emotion usually arises in response to a certain eliciting stimulus or event, exhibiting intensity\nbut limited duration. On the other hand, mood is generally not tied to a specific stimulus, characterized by\nlower intensity and longer duration [162].\nEmotions play a major role in influencing decision making. Key findings from research on emotions and\ndecision-making include [ 109]: (1) Emotions exert a potent, predictable, sometimes harmful, and sometimes\nbeneficial impact on decision-making, affecting different types of decisions. (2) Emotions can generate effects\nthat are undesirable and subconscious. (3) Initially, emotions are often triggered swiftly, leading to rapid\nactions and (4) once activated, certain emotions, such as sadness, can promote more systematic thinking.\n5.4.2 Interactions with other Determinants\nEmotions and Mood, and Information Processing. TheAffect-as-Information Hypothesis suggests that\nemotions and mood act as sources of information [ 32]. The depth of processing is influenced by the presence\nof positive and negative emotions, which activate either heuristic or systematic information processing in\ndecision-making [ 147]. Consequently, individuals in a positive mood perceive their environment as benevolent,\nleading them to process information in a global and heuristic manner. Conversely, those in a negative mood\nview their environment as problematic, prompting them to process information analytically and diagnostically.\nThe Affect-as-Information Hypothesis is often relied upon when the target is affective, the information is\ncomplex, or time constraints exist [ 33]. Similarly, the Affect Infusion Model postulates that individuals process\ninformation corresponding with their mood state. This means that people in a negative mood tend to process\ninformation more accurately, analytically, and in more detail, while those in a positive mood engage in more\nsimplified and heuristic processing [ 50]. Research has also indicated that individuals in a negative mood are\ninclined to process information more systematically, whereas those in a positive mood are more likely to\nutilize heuristic processing [128].\nEmotions and Trust in AI. Human emotions can influence trust in AI and the use of AI. Emo-\ntional trust, such as feelings of safety, well-being, and satisfaction, can be distinguished from cognitive trust,\ni.e. people’s rational expectation that AI can perform well [ 99]. Incidental emotions, which are emotions not\ndirectly related to the task at hand, can significantly impact trust in unrelated settings. Emotions characterized\nby positive valence, such as happiness and gratitude, may enhance trust. Conversely, emotions with negative\nvalence, such as anxiety or anger, might reduce trust [41].\n22']","According to the Affect-as-Information Hypothesis, emotions and mood act as sources of information, influencing the depth of processing. Positive emotions lead to heuristic and global information processing, while negative emotions prompt analytical and diagnostic processing. The Affect Infusion Model suggests that individuals process information corresponding with their mood state: those in a negative mood process information more accurately, analytically, and in more detail, whereas those in a positive mood engage in more simplified and heuristic processing.",simple,"[{'page_label': '22', 'file_name': '2402.17385v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.17385v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1555705, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

We need a fair and explicit way to check if LLMs are really good at problem-solving with\ntools or if they are just using their memorized information.\nTo fill this gap, we introduce ToolQA, a question answering (QA) benchmark to evaluate LLMs’\nability in using external tools for answering questions. ToolQA comprises data from 8 domains and\ndefines 13 types of tools to acquire information from external reference corpora. Each instance in\nToolQA consists of a question, an answer, reference corpora, and a list of available tools. ToolQA is\nunique in that all its questions can be answered only by using appropriate tools to obtain information\nfrom the reference corpus. This minimizes the possibility of LLMs answering questions by merely\nrecalling their internal knowledge, and allows for faithfully evaluating LLMs’ abilities in using tools.\nToolQA is curated with an automated three-phase process: (1) The first phase, Reference Data\nCollection , involves gathering various types of public corpora including text, tables, and graphs from\ndifferent domains. These corpora have no overlap with the LLM pre-training data and will serve\nas reference corpora for tool-based question answering. (2) The second phase is Human-guided\nQuestion Generation with LLMs . In this phase, we generate questions that can only be answered by\nusing tools over the reference corpora. Our approach is a template-based question generation process,\nwhich includes human-guided template generation, template validation, and question instantiation\nwith tool attributes. (3) The third phase is Programmatic Answer Generation . This phase produces\naccurate answers for the generated questions. To ensure answer correctness, we implement operators\ncorresponding to the tools and obtain answers from the reference corpora programmatically. Our\nthree-phase procedure ensures that we generate questions that can only be answered using external\nknowledge, along with their precise answers. Additionally, the process is highly efficient and requires\nminimal human labeling efforts.\nWe conducted experiments using both standard LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs to answer questions\nin ToolQA. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT and Chain-of-thoughts prompting [ 57], which rely\nsolely on their internal knowledge, have low success rates of approximately 5% for easy questions and\n2% for hard questions. In contrast, tool-augmented LLMs such as Chameleon [ 28] and ReAct [ 66]\nperform better by leveraging external tools. For easy questions, the best performance achieved by\ntool-augmented LLMs is 43.15%, while for hard questions, the best performance drops to 8.2%.\nOur results and error analysis demonstrate that ToolQA is a challenging benchmark for existing\ntool-augmented LLM methods, especially for its hard questions that require more complex reasoning\nabout tool composition.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Knowledge-Augmented LLMs\nSeveral prior works aim to enhance LLMs with explicit external knowledge.

What conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of PEFT algorithms in federated fine-tuning of LLaMA-7B under different scenarios?,"['6.1 E FFECTIVENESS OF PEFT ALGORITHMS IN FS-LLM\nFirstly, we benchmark the performance of different PEFT algorithms in different application domains\nand scenarios.

We use a widely adopted LLM, LLaMA-7B, with\nthree PEFT algorithms5, including LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), P-tuning (Liu et al., 2021b), and\nprompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021). We employ FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017) as the federated\naggregation strategy. To conduct the experiments uniformly and fairly, we fix the FL-specific\nhyperparameters and the hyperparameters that have a large impact on the computation cost for\nall experiments. For example, we set the communication round to 500, the local update step to\n30, and the batch size to 1. We perform a grid search for algorithm-specific and learning-related\nhyperparameters to obtain the optimal configuration. For example, the search space of the learning\nrate is{1×10−4,3×10−4,5×10−4,1×10−3,3×10−3,5×10−3}. Please refer to Appendix A.3\nfor more algorithm-specific hyperparameters corresponding to each PEFT algorithm. Moreover, to\nfurther reduce the GPU memory consumption for efficiency, we employ the half-precision operator\nduring fine-tuning.\nTable 2: Performance comparisons among different PEFT algorithms when fine-tuning LLaMA-7B\nin FL: Evaluation Scores(%) ±standard deviation(%).\nAlgorithm Scenario Fed-CodeAlpaca Fed-Dolly Fed-GSM8K-3\nLoRAGlobal 13.54 ±0.24 46.25 ±0.44 14.81 ±1.04\nFed 13.29 ±0.10 46.57 ±0.24 14.25 ±1.37\nLocal 10.99 ±0.77 43.98 ±1.38 11.88 ±1.35\nP-tuningGlobal 10.24 ±0.30 41.29 ±0.01 12.13 ±0.41\nFed 9.71 ±0.66 41.50 ±0.32 11.75 ±0.39\nLocal 7.78 ±2.27 38.76 ±2.39 11.42 ±0.96\nPrompt tuningGlobal 9.80 ±1.79 41.24 ±0.54 9.75 ±1.49\nFed 9.63 ±0.36 40.72 ±0.64 9.86 ±0.59\nLocal 7.18 ±2.17 37.65 ±6.12 9.65 ±0.77\nResults and Analysis.

How does MISAR utilize egocentric video and speech inputs to enhance state estimation in augmented reality environments?,"['to-text model, enhancing relevance and accuracy through advanced language processing capabilities.\nIntegrating sensory inputs with the LLM’s analytical power notably enhances state estimation\ncapabilities within augmented reality environments. Empirical results show a significant improvement\nin the linguistic alignment of MISAR-generated captions with reference recipes, particularly evident\nin descriptions of medium-length recipe steps. GPT-3.5’s intervention in the captioning process\ncontributes to this enhancement. However, the current configuration of MISAR has limitations. Errors\nfrom the video-to-text model can propagate through the system, and there is a lack of comprehension\nof environmental audio elements [ 87]. MISAR uses egocentric video and speech inputs, along with\ncontextual data from language models, to refine state estimation in augmented reality contexts. This\napproach highlights MISAR’s potential in facilitating users’ performance of physical tasks through a\nsophisticated synthesis of visual, auditory, and contextual information.\n3.2 Vid-LLM Pretraining\nLaViLa [88]. LaViLa can handle multiple multimodal tasks in egocentric videos, including multiple-\nchoice question, multi-instance retrieval, action recognition, and natural language query. It models\nvideos by employing the Narrator and the Rephraser, which are adapted from LLMs. The Narrator\nis a GPT-2 [ 127] which is visually conditioned with additional cross-attention modules before each\nTransformer decoder layer to attend text to visual information, automatically generates dense textual\nnarrations from video clips, focusing on detailed and varied descriptions. The Rephraser, another\nLLM based on T5-large, augments these narrations by paraphrasing, enhancing text diversity and\ncoverage. The model is trained on video-narration pairs from the Ego4D dataset and evaluated on the\nEpic-Kitchens, Ego4D, EGTEA [ 130], and CharadesEgo datasets [ 131]. The model does not support\nprocessing audio or speech from videos.\nVid2Seq [89]. Vid2Seq is for dense video captioning. It combines an LLM with special time tokens to\nsimultaneously predict event boundaries and textual descriptions within videos. It concatenates video\nframe features with text tokens in a sequence. Pre-trained on a vast collection of unlabeled, untrimmed,\nnarrated videos from the YT-Temporal-1B dataset, Vid2Seq leverages pseudo-event boundaries and\ncaptions from transcribed speech. It is fine-tuned and evaluated on YouCook2 [ 132], ViTT [ 133],\nActivityNet Captions, MSR-VTT, and MSVD for dense video captioning, event localization, video\nparagraph captioning, and video clip captioning. The model is not designed for natural audio input\nbut can deal with speech from videos by ASR.\nVAST [90]. The V AST model can handle multimodal tasks, including video captioning, video\nquestion answering, video retrieval, and audio captioning by transferring all modalities - video,\naudio, speech, and language - into texts, which will be summarized or revised to adapt to different\ntasks or inputs with an LLM. Different from Vid-LLMs agents, the model is further pre-trained on\nthe V AST-27M dataset encompassing 27 million video clips on different pre-training objectives:\nomni-modality video-caption contrastive/matching/generation loss. It is fine-tuned and evaluated on\na wide range of datasets, including YouCook2, TVC [ 134], V ALOR-32K [ 135], V ATEX [ 136], MSR-\nVTT, MUSIC-A VQA, ActivityNet-QA, MSR-VTT-QA, TGIF-FrameQA, DiDeMo, Flickr [ 137],\nClothoV1 [138], ClothoV2 [138], and AudioCap [139].\nMerlin [91]. The model Merlin handles video understanding tasks, including object tracking,\nvideo referring, video relation, and future reasoning, by utilizing an architecture that integrates\nvisual tokens from images and videos into language sequences for LLMs. It employs Foresight\nPre-Training (FPT) and Foresight Instruction-Tuning (FIT) to model and predict object trajec-\ntories and future events from video frames. Merlin’s effectiveness was evaluated using vari-\nous datasets, including LAION400M [ 140], Object365 [ 141], OpenImage [ 142], LaSOT [ 143],\nGOT10K [ 144], MOT17 [ 145], DanceTrack [ 146], SOMPT22 [ 147], Ref-COCO [ 148], VCR [ 149],\nLLaV A-665K [ 150], MultiSports [ 151], TITAN [ 152], and STAR [ 153].

How does the research suggest incorporating knowledge about linguistic structure and content into models can improve language mastery?,"['directly predicted.\nOur research implies that full language mastery\nneeds a different approach from one in which one\nseeks to build ever larger LLMs with language\nmasking or autoregressive training.

Our results however rely on certain, rather\nmild hypotheses about learning. We do not know\nhow our claims fare when different assumptions\nabout learning are made.\nAnother limitation is that we have not looked at\npotential ways of restricting learning hypotheses\nabout the meanings of linguistic expressions. Di-\nrectly relevant are the constraints on generalized\nquantiﬁers of Barwise and Cooper (1981 ). Nor\nhave we said much about compositionality and\nlearning, although they are well known to inter-\nact. Ideally, we should assign a meaning to every\nwhich consists in a reduced hypothesis space, but\nthat has to combine with the meanings of, say, the\nother words in (2).\nA third limitation concerns the extent to which\nan LLM can leverage what it has been trained to\ndo in learning semantic concepts on other tasks.\nIn many experiments we see that an LLM can ap-\npear to learn X but then cannot exploit X in task\nY . We leave this issue for future research, but we\nbelieve it may be key to understanding debates\nabout LLM performance and the role of forgetting\nin LLM learning ( Kirkpatrick et al. ,2017 ).\nEthics Statement\nWe show that LLM reliability in gauging the ac-\ncuracy of universal quantiﬁers is limited. Given\nhow quantiﬁcation is linked to concepts like se-\nmantic consequence, it means that we cannot as-\nsume LLMs to have anything like full semantic\ncompetence. This suggests that we cannot fully\ntrust them with tasks where accuracy on reasoning\nis required.

Through extensive\ncomparisons and analyses (in Section §6), we show\nthat Punish and Explain perform the best in their\ngroup and combining them can achieve the best\nbalance between alignment and accuracy stably.\nTo validate whether our proposed methods can\nalso benefit adaptive retrieval augmentation, we\ncompare the performance of only triggering re-\ntrieval when the models express uncertainty using\nPunish, Explain, Punish+Explain, and the vanilla\nprompt without any special strategy (See Sec-\ntion §7).

A promising direction\nto address the issue of significant resource consumption is\nsparse computation, which is enabled by the observation of\nsparse activation in LLMs (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023).\nSparse activation refers to the phenomenon where certain\nmodel parameters contribute weakly for a given input, im-\nplying that excluding these parameters would have a neg-\nligible impact on the final model result. These weakly-\ncontributed parameters are regarded as not activated for the\ngiven input, and can be skipped during inference to achieve\nsparse computation. Previous efforts primarily focus on\nsparsely deploying the LLMs using the ReLU activation\nfunction, by utilizing the occurrence of zeros in activation\nvalues (Zhang et al., 2022b; Mirzadeh et al., 2023), and\nhave achieved promising results. Parameters corresponding\nto the zero activation values contribute nothing to the final\nresult, allowing for their exclusion in computation.\nIn this paper, we broaden the scope of sparse activation in\nLLMs by moving beyond zero activation values to include\nmore activation functions and achieve higher sparsity ratios.\nMore specifically, we propose to define the neuron activa-\ntion based on whether neuron output magnitudes1exceed\na magnitude threshold, which is a more general activation\ndefinition. Our pilot investigation studies the distribution of\nneuron output magnitudes within LLMs, revealing a long-\ntail pattern where many neuron output magnitudes are small.\nIn some cases, even though the activation values of neurons\nare not exactly zero, their output magnitudes are still small\nenough to be negligible. This insight opens new perspec-\ntives, particularly evident in our discovery that a series of\nLLMs that do not employ ReLU, i.e., LLaMA (Touvron\net al., 2023b), are also sparsely activated. Furthermore, our\nanalysis shows that within the LLMs using ReLU, the activa-\ntion sparsity ratio formalized with long-tailed neuron output\nmagnitudes is significantly higher than the ratio formalized\nwith zero activation values.\nAs we find sparse activation is prevalent in LLMs across\nvarious activation functions, it prompts an essential ques-\ntion: which activation function is optimal for sparse LLMs?\n1The output of a feed-forward network in LLMs can be treated\nas the summation of the outputs of all neurons in the network.\n1arXiv:2402.03804v1  [cs.LG]  6 Feb 2024']","Neuron output magnitudes play a role in defining sparse activation in LLMs by determining whether the output magnitudes exceed a magnitude threshold.

How has scaling up the techniques used to train large language models contributed to the development of economically valuable systems?,"['Eight Things to Know about Large Language Models\nFigure 1. Excerpted from OpenAI (2023b): A scaling law result for one measure of language model performance, showing a consistent\ntrend as the amount of computation used to train a model is scaled up 10,000,000,000 ×times from a small prototype system to GPT-4.\nat producing economically valuable systems.\nConcretely, consider these three superﬁcially very differ-\nent systems: OpenAI’s original GPT can perform simple\ntext-labeling tasks but cannot generally produce coherent\ntext (Radford et al., 2018). GPT-2 adds the ability to pro-\nduce text of reasonably high quality, as well as a limited\nability to follow simple instructions (Radford et al., 2019).\nGPT-3 is the ﬁrst modern general-purpose LLM, and is prac-\ntically useful across a wide range of language tasks. The\ndesigns of these three models hardly differ at all. Instead,\nthe qualitative differences between them stem from vast\ndifferences in scale: Training GPT-3 used roughly 20,000 ×\nmore computation than training the original GPT (Sevilla\net al., 2022), as well as signiﬁcantly more data and parame-\nters. There aresubstantial innovations that distinguish these\nthree models, but they are almost entirely restricted to in-\nfrastructural innovations in high-performance computing\nrather than model-design work that is speciﬁc to language\ntechnology.\nWhile the techniques used to train the newest LLMs are no\nlonger generally disclosed, the most recent detailed reports\nsuggest that there have been only slight deviations from\nthis trend, and that designs of these systems are still largely\nunchanged (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al., 2022;\nTouvron et al., 2023).\nContinuing to scale these techniques up beyond GPT-3 has\nproduced further economically valuable returns: The subse-\nquent GPT-4 model outperforms qualiﬁed humans on many\ngraduate and professional exams (OpenAI, 2023b), and its\ndevelopment helped prompt a multi-billion-dollar invest-\nment in the company that built it (Capoot, 2023). Scalinglaws allowed the creators of GPT-4 to cheaply and accu-\nrately predict a key overall measure of its performance:\nThis forecast was made by ﬁtting a statistical trend in the\nperformance of small models, which collectively took about\n0.1% of the resources needed by the ﬁnal model, and then\nextrapolating out that trend (see Figure 1).\n2. Speciﬁc important behaviors in LLM tend\nto emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of\nincreasing investment\nScaling laws generally only predict a model’s pretraining\ntest loss , which measures the model’s ability to correctly\npredict how an incomplete piece of text will be continued.1\nWhile this measure is correlated with how useful a model\nwill be on average across many practical tasks (Radford\net al., 2019), it is largely notpossible to predict when mod-\nels will start to show speciﬁc skills or become capable of\nspeciﬁc tasks (see Figure 2; Steinhardt, 2021; Ganguli et al.,\n2022a; Wei et al., 2022a). Often, a model can fail at some\ntask consistently, but a new model trained in the same way\nat ﬁve or ten times the scale will do well at that task.\n1Much of the data and computer time that goes into building a\nmodern LLM is used in an expensive initial pretraining process.\nLanguage-model pretraining intuitively resembles the autocom-\nplete task: In it, an artiﬁcial neural network model takes in a text\none word at a time, makes a probabilistic prediction about which\nword will come next, and has its behavior incrementally adjusted\nto make it assign a greater probability to the actual next word in\nsimilar contexts in the future. Pretraining test loss measures how\neffectively an LLM has learned to make these predictions.']","Scaling up the techniques used to train large language models has contributed to the development of economically valuable systems by producing models like GPT-4, which outperforms qualified humans on many graduate and professional exams.

How do autoregressive models perform in topic prediction compared to other models like BERT and LDA?,"['and the model’s goal is to predict the original words at the\nmasked indices only by considering their surrounding context.\nUnlike autoregressive models, the MLM does not model a\ncoherent joint distribution of the data [Yamakoshi et al., 2022,\nYoung and You, 2022]. However, the log objective can be\nextended as follows,\nLMLM (x1:N) =X\nn∈Mlogp(xn|xi,i∈U)\n=X\nn∈MlogZ\np(xn|θ)p(θ|xi,i∈U)dθ. (5)\nwhere Mdenotes the set of masked indices, and Udenotes\nthe set of unmasked indices. The proof is given in Appendix\nA.1, and is a simple extension of the derivation for the autore-\ngressive version. The difference between the MLM objective\nand the autoregressive objective is that in the summation, the\nprediction of each token xnuses the same posterior over the\nlatent variable p(θ|xi,i∈U). In other words, each token xnis\npredicted independently from the latent variable θ. As a result,\nMLM forms a less expressive Bayesian inference objective\nthan autoregressive models. Therefore, we aim to empirically\nevaluate both the ability of MLM to recover latent variables,\nand whether its performance forms a contrast against that of\nautoregressive models.\n3.2 Probing for Topic Mixtures\nIn this section we discuss the methodology for recovering\ntopic mixtures from LLMs.\nLLMs conduct downstream tasks, including predicting the\nnext word xN+1, via an embedding of the seen sequence\nf(x1:N). Based on the analysis above, we expect f(x1:N)to\nbe sufficient to reconstruct the distribution over topics given\nobserved data p(θ|x1:n). Concretely, for each document i, we\ndefine the input as the LLM-learned document embedding\nf(x1:N)i. We define the target as a topic mixture θithat\nis sampled from p(θ|x1:n)learned by LDA. Thus, LDA is\na proxy for ground truth topic distribution. This target is\nanalogous to a soft-label classification target. The topic probe\nmaps from the document embedding to the topic mixture\ntarget. To ensure that statistical model learning is contained\nin the LLM, not in the probe, we keep the probe simple by\ndefining it as a linear classifier with softmax activations. In\nsummary, given a natural corpus and a pretrained LLM, the\nsteps to probe topics are,\n1. Train LDA with Ktopics on the corpus.\n2. For each document i,\n(a) Get LLM embedding f(x1:N)i.\n(b) Get LDA topic mixture θi.\n3.Train topic probe gby minimizing the cross-entropy loss:\n−1\nNPN\ni=1PK\nk=1θiklogg(f(x1:N)i)k.\nOn synthetic data, however, the LLM is instead trained on\ndata sampled from an LDA model that is manually defined(i.e., not trained), and the topic probe targets the ground-truth\ntopic mixtures instead of topic mixtures that are estimated by\na trained LDA model. The steps for synthetic data generation\nand exploration are detailed in Section 4.1.\nImplementation. The document embedding f(x1:N)is de-\nrived from the LLM embedding for each token of the se-\nquence, which is by default the representation of the final\nlayer before the LLM prediction head. In an experiment, we\nalso search across layers as the document embedding. The op-\ntions for document embedding f(x1:N)are the embedding of\neach individual token in the final layer, as well as an average\nof all token embeddings in this layer. In each case study, we\nchoose the one that gives best topic recovery performance. In\ngeneral, for both autoregressive models and MLM, either the\nlast token embedding or the average gives best performance,\ndepending on the dataset.\n4 EXPERIMENTS\nWe empirically evaluate the extent to which LLMs recover\ntopic mixture on three datasets: a synthetic dataset, 20News-\ngroups (20NG), and WikiText-103 .\nTable 1: Topic prediction performance of the autoregressive\ntransformer (AT), BERT, LDA, and word-embedder (WE) on\nthe synthetic datasets.

What are some methods used to enhance KG-to-text generation systems?,"['JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. ??, NO. ??, MONTH 20YY 17\nBrarck Obama\nPoliticianOf\nUSAHonolulu\nBornIn\nLocatedIn\nCapitalOf\nWashingto\nD.C.MarriedT o\nMichelle\nObamaLiveInKGs\nLLMsBrack Obama  is a\npolitician of  USA .

The general framework of KG-to-text generation.\ntask. As shown in Fig. 21, both works simply represent\nthe input graph as a linear traversal and find that such\na naive approach successfully outperforms many existing\nstate-of-the-art KG-to-text generation systems. Interestingly,\nRibeiro et al. [167] also find that continue pre-training could\nfurther improve model performance. However, these meth-\nods are unable to explicitly incorporate rich graph semantics\nin KGs. To enhance LLMs with KG structure information,\nJointGT [42] proposes to inject KG structure-preserving\nrepresentations into the Seq2Seq large language models.\nGiven input sub-KGs and corresponding text, JointGT first\nrepresents the KG entities and their relations as a sequence\nof tokens, then concatenate them with the textual tokens\nwhich are fed into LLM. After the standard self-attention\nmodule, JointGT then uses a pooling layer to obtain the\ncontextual semantic representations of knowledge entities\nand relations. Finally, these pooled KG representations are\nthen aggregated in another structure-aware self-attention\nlayer. JointGT also deploys additional pre-training objec-\ntives, including KG and text reconstruction tasks given\nmasked inputs, to improve the alignment between text and\ngraph information. Li et al. [168] focus on the few-shot\nscenario. It first employs a novel breadth-first search (BFS)\nstrategy to better traverse the input KG structure and feed\nthe enhanced linearized graph representations into LLMs\nfor high-quality generated outputs, then aligns the GCN-\nbased and LLM-based KG entity representation. Colas et\nal. [169] first transform the graph into its appropriate repre-\nsentation before linearizing the graph. Next, each KG node\nis encoded via a global attention mechanism, followed by\na graph-aware attention module, ultimately being decoded\ninto a sequence of tokens. Different from these works, KG-\nBART [37] keeps the structure of KGs and leverages the\ngraph attention to aggregate the rich concept semantics in\nthe sub-KG, which enhances the model generalization on\nunseen concept sets.\n5.4.2 Constructing large weakly KG-text aligned Corpus\nAlthough LLMs have achieved remarkable empirical suc-\ncess, their unsupervised pre-training objectives are not nec-\nessarily aligned well with the task of KG-to-text genera-\ntion, motivating researchers to develop large-scale KG-text\naligned corpus. Jin et al. [170] propose a 1.3M unsupervised\nKG-to-graph training data from Wikipedia. Specifically, they\nfirst detect the entities appearing in the text via hyperlinks\nand named entity detectors, and then only add text that\nshares a common set of entities with the correspondingknowledge graph, similar to the idea of distance supervision\nin the relation extraction task [232]. They also provide a\n1,000+ human annotated KG-to-Text test data to verify the\neffectiveness of the pre-trained KG-to-Text models. Simi-\nlarly, Chen et al. [171] also propose a KG-grounded text\ncorpus collected from the English Wikidump. To ensure the\nconnection between KG and text, they only extract sentences\nwith at least two Wikipedia anchor links. Then, they use\nthe entities from those links to query their surrounding\nneighbors in WikiData and calculate the lexical overlapping\nbetween these neighbors and the original sentences. Finally,\nonly highly overlapped pairs are selected. The authors ex-\nplore both graph-based and sequence-based encoders and\nidentify their advantages in various different tasks and\nsettings.\n5.5 LLM-augmented KG Question Answering\nKnowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to find\nanswers to natural language questions based on the struc-\ntured facts stored in knowledge graphs [233], [234]. The\ninevitable challenge in KGQA is to retrieve related facts and\nextend the reasoning advantage of KGs to QA. Therefore,\nrecent studies adopt LLMs to bridge the gap between nat-\nural language questions and structured knowledge graphs\n[174], [175], [235]. The general framework of applying LLMs\nfor KGQA is illustrated in Fig. 22, where LLMs can be used\nas 1) entity/relation extractors, and 2) answer reasoners.\n5.5.1 LLMs as Entity/relation Extractors\nEntity/relation extractors are designed to identify entities\nand relationships mentioned in natural language questions\nand retrieve related facts in KGs. Given the proficiency in\nlanguage comprehension, LLMs can be effectively utilized\nfor this purpose. Lukovnikov et al. [172] are the first to uti-\nlize LLMs as classifiers for relation prediction, resulting in a\nnotable improvement in performance compared to shallow\nneural networks. Nan et al. [174] introduce two LLM-based\nKGQA frameworks that adopt LLMs to detect mentioned\nentities and relations. Then, they query the answer in KGs\nusing the extracted entity-relation pairs. QA-GNN [131]\nuses LLMs to encode the question and candidate answer\npairs, which are adopted to estimate the importance of\nrelative KG entities. The entities are retrieved to form a\nsubgraph, where an answer reasoning is conducted by a\ngraph neural network. Luo et al. [173] use LLMs to calculate\nthe similarities between relations and questions to retrieve\nrelated facts, formulated as\ns(r, q) =LLM(r)⊤LLM(q), (12)\nwhere qdenotes the question, rdenotes the relation, and\nLLM(·)would generate representation for qandr, respec-\ntively. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [236] propose a LLM-based\npath retriever to retrieve question-related relations hop-by-\nhop and construct several paths. The probability of each\npath can be calculated as\nP(p|q) =|p|Y\nt=1s(rt, q), (13)\nwhere pdenotes the path, and rtdenotes the relation at the\nt-th hop of p. The retrieved relations and paths can be used']","Some methods used to enhance KG-to-text generation systems include: 1) representing the input graph as a linear traversal, 2) injecting KG structure-preserving representations into Seq2Seq large language models, 3) employing a novel breadth-first search (BFS) strategy to better traverse the input KG structure, 4) transforming the graph into its appropriate representation before linearizing it, and 5) leveraging graph attention to aggregate rich concept semantics in the sub-KG.",simple,"[{'page_label': '17', 'file_name': '2306.08302v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2306.08302v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 3347785, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
What are Large Language Models (LLM) and what characteristics do they possess?,"['2 of 26medical and ﬁnancial document analysis, many language models are employed in thebusiness[4,15,23].\nFigure 1.Distribution of language modelsAs per Figure1. numerous language models have emerged. Language models with alot of parameters and great processing power are collectively referred to as ""Large LanguageModels"" (LLM)[24]. Whereas A sort of language model known as a statistical languagemodel (SLM) uses statistical methods to give probability values to word sequences in alanguage. It is predicated on the notion that by examining the frequencies and patternsfound in a sizable corpus of text, it is possible to predict the likelihood of a speciﬁc wordappearing in a speciﬁc situation[25].In a Neural Language Model (NLM), the probabilitydistribution of word sequences in a language is modeled using neural network topologies.NLMs are made to catch intricate word relationships and produce text that is appropriate forthe surrounding context[26,27]. The term ""Transformer Language Models"" (TLMs) is usedto describe language models that especially make use of the Transformer architecture[3].The term ""pre-trained language models"" (PLMs) refers to language models that have beentrained in an unsupervised fashion on sizable corpora before being adjusted for particulardownstream tasks. By extracting patterns and structures from massive volumes of textdata, these models learn representations of generic language.

The dashed line represents the random baseline.\nFor the age personas, we observe a clear trend of increased performance for both LLMs as they\nimpersonate older characters. The progression is particularly pronounced for ChatGPT, where on\nStanford Cars the 2-year-old persona describes different cars with similar expressions leading to\n∼4%accuracy, but as ChatGPT’s persona gets older, it becomes more accurate in describing cars,\ne.g. 54.9% for persona of age 20. This indicates that LLMs can replicate human language at different\ndevelopment stages, varying their language both in terms of vocabulary and general knowledge for\naccurately describing these objects as discussed in [ 84]. Similarly to the reasoning task, LLMs\nexhibit higher expertise on the topic when we ask them to impersonate a bird expert (“ornithologist”\npersona) and a car expert (“car mechanic” persona). The respective domain expert persona performs\napproximately twice as well as the non-domain expert persona when using ChatGPT. Impersonating\nan expert, the LLM tends to describe a class in more detail and mention more discriminative features.\nWe also observe that impersonation can reveal biases encoded in the LLMs. A race bias becomes\napparent when we ask the LLMs to impersonate a “black” or “white” person. ChatGPT tends to\ndescribe both birds and cars better when posing as a white person. Vicuna-13B, on the other hand,\nprovides better descriptions of cars as a black person. Gender biases are a bit less noticeable, but we\nstill find Vicuna-13B giving better bird descriptions as a woman persona and ChatGPT identifying\ncars better as a man persona. While instruction-based fine-tuning [ 64] tries to remedy social biases\nencoded in LLMs to some extent, we can still expose them through in-context impersonation.\nOverall, we find that ChatGPT shows larger effects, probably due to its access to more diverse (fine-\ntuning) data. The fact that the effects described above can be found with two very different language\nmodels suggests that they are a result of the overall language modeling and instruction following\ntraining on internet data instead of specific model artifacts.\nQualitative results and limitations. In Figure 7, we provide the descriptions generated by ChatGPT\nand Vicuna for one class, i.e. black billed cuckoo, from the CUB dataset and one class, i.e. AM\nGeneral Hummer SUV 2000, from the Stanford Cars dataset. As personas, we sample all the age\npersonas we considered in our experiments, namely 2, 4, 7, 13 and 20-year-old personas.\nFor both LLMs, in both datasets, we observe that with increasing age, the complexity of the vo-\ncabulary and attributes of the mentioned objects increases. A 2-year-old persona talks about the\nsound the bird or the car makes, the shapes of the wings or wheels, and the emotions attached to\nseeing or riding it. A 4-year-old persona interestingly mentions experiences seeing the bird or the\ncar more distinctly. A 7-year-old persona starts using more complicated adjective phrases, e.g. can\ndrive on rough roads and outside places, whereas a 13-year-old persona takes it one step further, e.g.\nbrownish-gray body with distinctive rusty colored markings. Finally, a 20-year-old persona makes a\nmore complete description of the object including where the bird is found or what the car is mainly\nused for. This is in line with [ 85] where the authors show that given the same length of text, smaller\nchildren use less diverse and non-academic vocabulary, and repeat a lot.

Head Prompt\nThe head prompt is the text that explains the rules of the games to the LLMs. In our work, we designed different prompts for\neach of the games.\n•Tic-Tac-Toe\nHead Prompt: Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a grid. Players take turns marking a space with\ntheir respective symbols. The goal is to get 3 of one’s own symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or\ndiagonally, before the opponent does. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a\ndraw. The Tic Tac Toe game is played on a 3 by 3 grid, with the winning length as 3. Each move is represented by\na string consisting of two parts: the column (C) and the row (R), in that order. For instance, C1R2 means the\nmovement at the position of the first column and the second row of the grid. You are playing this game with the\nuser (opponent).\n•Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma\nHead Prompt: You and your partner are in the Prisoner’s Dilemma situation. Specifically, if you <Testify >\nagainst your partner and your partner remains <Silent >,you will go free while your partner will get 3 years in\nprison on the main charge. If you remain <Silent >but your partner <Testify >against you, you will serve 3\nyears in prison and your partner will be set free. If you and your partner <Testify >against each other, you and\nyour partner will each serve 2 years. If both you and your partner remain <Silent >, you and your partner will\neach serve 1 year.\n•Breakthrough\nHead Prompt: Breakthrough is a two-player game played on a rectangular board. Players take turns moving their\npieces, which can move one space straight or diagonally forward if the target square is empty. A piece can also\nmove diagonally forward to capture an opponent’s piece. Capturing is optional, and a player can only capture one\npiece per turn. The goal is to be the first to reach the opponent’s home row, the farthest row from the player. If all\nof a player’s pieces are captured, they lose. The game does not allow draws, as pieces can only move forward or\nbe captured. The Breakthrough board is identified by columns labeled starting from A (from left to right) and\nrows numbered 1 to 8 (from bottom to top). The intersection of a column and a row specifies a unique square on\nthe board.\n•Connect Four\nHead Prompt: Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game, where the players choose a color and then\ntake turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the\nnext available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical,\nor diagonal line of four of one’s own discs. You are a gaming agent who aims to beat me in Connect 4 games.\nEach move is represented by a string consisting of two parts: the column (C) and the row (R), in that order. For\ninstance, C1 means the first column.\n•First-price sealed-bid auction\nHead Prompt: A first-price sealed-bid auction (FPSBA) is a common type of auction. It is also known as the\nblind auction.

First, p re-training:  LLMs  are pre -trained on large \namounts of textual data to learn intricate linguistic, syntactic, and textual structures  (P. Liu et al., 2023) . This \nunsupervised learning phase lays the foundation for the big language model to understand the language.  \nSecond, fine-tuning: LLM can be fine -tuned for a specific task or domain after pre -training to make it \nadaptable and suitable for a wide range of applications (Liu et al., 2022) . This fine -tuning process ensures \nthe model can generate contextually relevant responses and engage in meaningful conversations or tasks.  \nThird, language comprehension:  LLMs  have demonstrated a remarkable ability to understand and develop  \nhuman -like text.

In the training stage, previous research\nhas explored training data curation or knowledge grounding\nmethods to incorporate more knowledge [ 186,370,607,647].\nIn the inference stage, recent works have investigated meth-\nods including confidence estimation (or uncertainty estima-\ntion) [ 201,501,567], knowledge retrieval [ 120,214,264,306,\n338,508,526,601], enabling citations [ 132,192], model edt-\ning [ 275,337,424,593], multi-agent collaboration [ 90,110],\nprompting [ 105,544] and decoding strategy design [ 88,253].\n4.3.2 Improving Safety of LLMs. The safety guard of\nLLMs aims to prevent malicious users exploiting LLMs to\ngenerate harmful content including various types of misin-\nformation, which has been emphasized in a variety of survey\npapers [ 15,44,52,63,64,73,91,101,102,113,117,151,171,\n196,224,237,281,305,347,435,446,522,529,548,577]. A\nline of works has evaluated or benchmarked the safety of\nvarious LLMs [ 203,205,288,386,412,511,523,524,569,595,\n621,636,649,653]. Generally, the safety of LLMs can also\nbe strengthened in both training andinference stage. In the\ntraining stage, previous works focus on designing alignment\ntraining approaches such as reinforcement learning from hu-\nman feedback (RLHF) to align LLMs with humans’ values [ 29,\n30,43,121,209,242,365,441,472,492,531,591,642,643]. In\ntheinference stage, existing research has studied red team-\ning methods to find LLMs’ flaws [ 58,129,250,332,334,385,\n447,465,598,604,612,652], prompt injection or jailbreak ap-\nproaches to probe LLMs’ safety risks [ 100,145,199,220,247,\n263,300,302,303,396,404,408,443,574,590], and defense\nmethods for the evolving jailbreaks [ 170,172,236,417,541].\n4.3.3 Detecting LLM-Generated Misinformation.

Recently, more research fo-\ncuses on machine-generated misinformation or neural misin-\nformation, suggesting that it is generated by neural models,\nsuch as [ 3,7,39,109,128,162,249,406,450,615] and its detec-\ntion methods [ 40,367,432,463,467,481]. In the age of LLMs,\nthere start to be some initial works exploring LLM-generated\nmisinformation detection [ 65,81,115,142,160,213,372,532,\n550,644], but more research is strongly desired. It is worth\nnoting that detecting LLM-generated misinformation holds\na close connection with the techniques in detecting LLM-\ngenerated texts, which can be directly adopted in detecting\nLLM-generated misinformation or take effect via notifying\nthe readers of the potential inauthenticity.

First, the general public should be educated about\nthe capacities and limitations of LLMs, which can include the\nunderstanding that while LLMs can produce coherent and\nplausible-sounding texts, the LLM-generated content may\ncontain nonfactual information. Thus, the public education\ncan potentially reduce the risk of normal people abusing\nLLMs and generating profound hallucinated information\nunintentionally. Second, it is imperative to enhance the pub-\nlic’s digital literacy and immunity against LLM-generated\nmisinformation. For example, the characteristics of LLM-\ngenerated misinformation and the identification approaches\nshould be taught in different communities, especially the mi-\nnority groups who have been found to be more susceptible\nto misinformation [207, 227, 310, 366, 371].\n4.4 Looking Ahead\nIn this subsection, we will discuss the potential risks of mis-\ninformation generated by LLMs as well as other large gener-\native AI models in the near future, which may not explicitly\nbe exhibited yet, including AI-generated multimodal mis-\ninformation, autonomous misinformation agents, cognitive\nsecurity and AI-manipulation, as well as the needed inter-\ndisciplinary countering measures.\n4.4.1 AI-Generated Multimodal Misinformation.

Specifically,\nthe retrieved documents not only supplement\nknowledge to help the LLM generate correct an-\nswers, but also serve as supporting evidence for\nthe user to verify the LLM’s output. However,\nthe widely used retrievers become the bottle-\nneck of the entire pipeline and limit the over-\nall performance. Their capabilities are usually\ninferior to LLMs since they often have much\nfewer parameters than the large language model\nand have not been demonstrated to scale well\nto the size of LLMs. If the retriever does not\ncorrectly find the supporting documents, the\nLLM can not generate the correct and verifi-\nable answer, which overshadows the LLM’s\nremarkable abilities. To address these limita-\ntions, we propose LLatrieval (Large Language\nModel Verified Re trieval ), where the LLM up-\ndates the retrieval result until it verifies that the\nretrieved documents can sufficiently support\nanswering the question. Thus, the LLM can\niteratively provide feedback to retrieval and fa-\ncilitate the retrieval result to fully support veri-\nfiable generation.

We do so by\nintroducing an additional distance component4,Ldist, to the loss:\nLSoftQE =αLdist(fθ(q+), fψ(q)) + (1 −α)Lcont, (3)\nwhere fθandfψare transformer-based [27] encoders that map expanded queries\nand queries to vectors in the learned embedding space respectively, and αis a\nhyper parameter that controls the weight assigned to each component of the\nloss, as in knowledge distillation [12]. In other words, the expanded query repre-\nsentations produced by the Q2D encoder (teacher) serve as target query repre-\nsentations used to distill information into the SoftQE query encoder (student).\nImportantly, the feature space is pre-defined by the Q2D dual-encoder, rather\nthan updated during training. Accordingly, we only learn to embed queries, and\nreuse the Q2D encoder to produce passage embeddings as they are already well-\naligned with the target query representations.\nWe additionally experiment with state-of-the-art dense retrievers [28,29] that\naretrainedusingKLdivergencefromcross-encoderscores[20].Weapply SoftQE\nto distilled retrievers by simply combining the 3 objective terms with an addi-\ntional weight controlled by β:\nLSQE+KD =αLdist(fθ(q+), fψ(q)) + (1 −α) [βKL(fθ, fCE) + (1−β)Lcont],(4)\nas we find the information distilled through cross-encoder scores and expanded\nquery representations to be complementary.\n3 Experiments\nDatasets, Metrics, and Baselines.

How does neuron activation predictivity benefit sparse computation in practice?,"['Discovering Efficient Activation Functions for Sparse LLMs\nAlthough previous works on activation function selection\nhave focused on the performance of LLMs, we argue that\nthe efficiency of sparse computation should also be consid-\nered so that the LLMs can proceed with efficient inference\nwhile preserving performance. To answer this question, we\nconsider three critical aspects: the relation between sparsity\nand performance, the sparsity predictivity, and the hardware\naffinity. (1) By adjusting the magnitude threshold, we ex-\nplore the trade-off between sparsity and performance. In\npractice, a slight performance compromise is acceptable for\nachieving a significantly higher sparsity ratio. (2) Predic-\ntivity is defined as the ability to identify inactive neurons\nprior to computation, which is an important factor that en-\nables sparse activation to optimize deployment (Liu et al.,\n2023). We study the predictivity of different activation\nfunctions by constructing a lightweight predictor to predict\nneuron activation behaviors. (3) Furthermore, it is crucial\nto acknowledge that theoretical efficiency gains do not al-\nways align with practical hardware performance. Therefore,\nour investigation emphasizes how sparse computation can\nbe optimized according to hardware features, with a par-\nticular focus on the computational relations both between\ntokens and between neurons. These relations can be used\nto enhance memory reuse and facilitate contiguous memory\naccess, which is pivotal for improving actual efficiency.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis fol-\nlowing the above three aspects on the LLMs with differ-\nent activation functions2, including ReLU (Nair & Hinton,\n2010), SwiGLU (Elfwing et al., 2018), ReGLU (Shazeer,\n2020), and ReLU2(So et al., 2021). Our findings are sum-\nmarized as follows: (1) With the same pre-training recipe\nand model size, models using ReGLU and ReLU2achieve\ncomparable performance to models using SwiGLU, even\nthough SwiGLU is the most popular activation function\nused by existing LLMs. Models using ReLU2achieve the\nbest trade-off between performance and sparsity, e.g., per-\nformance degradation is less than 0.1%at a sparsity ratio\nclose to 90%. (2) Models using ReLU and ReLU2have the\nhighest neuron activation predictivity, which is beneficial for\nsparse computation in practice. (3) The hardware affinity of\nthe models using ReLU and ReLU2is better than that of the\nmodels using SwiGLU and ReGLU. Specifically, the LLMs\nusing ReLU and ReLU2tend to activate similar neurons\nto process consecutive tokens and have higher frequency\ndifferences between highly co-activated neurons and lowly\nco-activated neurons. As a result, the I/O overhead of feed-\nforward networks using ReLU2can be reduced by 92% by\nutilizing these features.\nOur contributions are summarized below:\n•We reformulate a more general activation definition\n2All model checkpoints we trained are available at https:\n//huggingface.co/SparseLLMbased on neuron output magnitudes with a magnitude\nthreshold instead of focusing on zero activation values.\n•We propose a systematic framework to examine sparse\ncomputation from three aspects: the trade-off between\nsparsity and performance, the predictivity, and the hard-\nware affinity, to find the most efficient activation func-\ntion to achieve sparse LLMs.\n•Our experiments show ReLU2achieves good results in\nall three aspects, suggesting that ReLU2is a promising\nactivation function for sparse LLMs.\n2.

More details on LLMs can refer to\nthe surveys (Bommasani et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023).\nEfficient Inference of LLMs. LLM inference represents\na complex challenge that necessitates a synergistic com-\nbination of algorithms and systems. From an algorithmic\nperspective, researchers have explored various methods to\nreduce time and memory overheads, including compressing\nmodel parameters (Michel et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2022;\nFrantar et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2023;\nXiao et al., 2023), modifying model structures (Ainslie et al.,\n2023; Peng et al., 2023; Gu & Dao, 2023; van den Brand\net al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021; Kitaev et al., 2020), and\noptimizing decoding methods (Leviathan et al., 2023; Chen\net al., 2023; Spector & R ´e, 2023; Cai et al., 2024). On the\nsystem side, there is a focus on how computing LLMs can\nbe seamlessly integrated with the hardware features (Am-\ninabadi et al., 2022; Rajbhandari et al., 2022; Chen et al.,\n2020; Fang et al., 2021; Pope et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021;\nYu et al., 2022), leading to the development of more effi-\ncient frameworks like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and\nvLLM (Kwon et al., 2023). Sparse activation, in particular,\nbecomes a research area that demands an even tighter inte-\ngration of algorithmic and systemic approaches. On the one\nhand, the selection of activation functions and the activation\npredictor construction are algorithm problems. On the other\nhand, how to fully exploit the sparse activation of LLMs on\nspecific hardware is a system problem. Researchers have\nachieved promising results in building efficient LLM in-\nference systems by leveraging sparse activation (Liu et al.,\n2023; Song et al., 2023; Alizadeh et al., 2023).\nSparse Activation of LLMs. Sparse activation is a unique\nmodel property, which is widely observed in ReLU-based\nLLMs (Zhang et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2023), from T5 (Raf-\nfel et al., 2020) to OPT (Zhang et al., 2022a). Meanwhile,\nthis phenomenon is also observed in ReLU-based large-\nscale Transformers of other fields, such as Vision Trans-\nformer (Li et al., 2023).

How do scaling laws affect the performance of compound inference systems that use multiple LLM calls?,"['Are More LLM Calls All You Need?\nTowards Scaling Laws of Compound Inference Systems\nLingjiao Chen†, Jared Quincy Davis†, Boris Hanin§,\nPeter Bailis∗, Ion Stoica‡, Matei Zaharia‡, James Zou†\n†Stanford University,‡UC Berkeley,∗Google,§Princeton University\nAbstract\nMany recent state-of-the-art results in language tasks were achieved using compound systems\nthat perform multiple Large Language Model (LLM) calls and aggregate their responses. However,\nthere is little understanding of how the number of LLM calls – e.g., when asking the LLM to\nanswer each question multiple times and taking a consensus – affects such a compound system’s\nperformance. In this paper, we initiate the study of scaling laws of compound inference systems.\nWe analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of LLM calls affects the performance\nof one-layer Voting Inference Systems – one of the simplest compound systems, which aggregates\nLLM responses via majority voting. We find empirically that across multiple language tasks,\nsurprisingly, Voting Inference Systems’ performance first increases but then decreases as a function\nof the number of LLM calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to\nthe diversity of query difficulties within a task: more LLM calls lead to higher performance on\n“easy” queries, but lower performance on “hard” queries, and non-monotone behavior emerges when\na task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number\nof samples, the number of LLM calls that maximizes system performance, and define a scaling law\nof Voting Inference Systems.

In addition to their superior performance, compound\nsystems are appealing because they are convenient to construct and debug [ZKC+24].\nA natural question is, thus, how does scaling the number of LLM calls affect the performance of\nsuch compound systems?

How does sequence scheduling improve the efficiency of LLM inference?,"['Response Length Perception and Sequence Scheduling:\nAn LLM-Empowered LLM Inference Pipeline\nZangwei Zheng1, Xiaozhe Ren2, Fuzhao Xue1, Yang Luo1, Xin Jiang2, Yang You1\n1Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore\n2Noah’s Ark Lab, Huawei.\n{zangwei, f-xue, yangluo, youy}@comp.nus.edu.sg; {renxiaozhe, jiang.xin}@huawei.com\nhttps://github.com/zhengzangw/Sequence-Scheduling\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of AI, demonstrating\nunprecedented capacity across various tasks.

In this paper, we propose an\nefficient LLM inference pipeline that harnesses the power of LLMs. Our approach\nbegins by tapping into the potential of LLMs to accurately perceive and predict\nthe response length with minimal overhead. By leveraging this information, we\nintroduce an efficient sequence scheduling technique that gathers queries with sim-\nilar response lengths into micro-batches. We evaluate our approach on real-world\ninstruction datasets using the LLaMA-based model, and our results demonstrate\nan impressive 86% improvement in inference throughput compared to the vanilla\nbatch inference without compromising effectiveness. Notably, our method is or-\nthogonal to other inference acceleration techniques, making it a valuable addition\nto many existing toolkits ( e.g. FlashAttention, Quantization) for LLM inference.\n1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) [2, 6, 15, 19] have transformed the field of natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) and have demonstrated remarkable success in various NLP tasks such as language\ntranslation [23], question-answering [28], and text summarization [38]. However, the deployment\nof LLMs at scale poses challenges due to their prohibitively expensive inference cost [1, 27]. The\ncomputational resources required to process millions of queries, as is the case with currently deployed\nLLMs like ChatGPT [19], are substantial. As a result, reducing the inference cost of LLMs has\nbecome a crucial research direction in recent years.\nIn real-world scenarios, the lengths of responses to various queries exhibit significant variability. As\ndepicted in Figure 2a, although different models display slightly diverse response length distributions,\na common pattern emerges with the presence of response lengths across a wide range. Consequently,\nwhen performing large language model (LLM) inference in batches, the inclusion of sequences with\ndiffering response lengths leads to inefficiencies. Shorter sequences are forced to wait for longer\nones to complete, resulting in computational waste. This issue is depicted on the left side of Figure 1,\nwhere redundant tokens account for a substantial portion (66%) of the overall tokens generated. Given\nthe quadratic time complexity of inference, such inefficiencies impose a significant burden on the\ninference process.\nHumans possess the ability to estimate the length of an answer to a question based on their understand-\ning of the query. For instance, questions like ""What is the capital of France?"" typically elicit shorter\nresponses compared to inquiries such as ""Can you explain the history of the French Revolution?""\nIntriguingly, we observe that LLMs fine-tuned for instruction comprehension, such as ChatGPT and\nClaude, also exhibit a certain degree of response length perception.

Prior work has looked\nat running the weights and activations of LLMs in 8-bit preci-\nsion [1], [2]. The most recent techniques focus on enabling\n4-bit integer quantization of weights while retaining FP16\nactivations [3], and 4-bit to 3-bit quantization of both weights\nand activations [4]. Beyond the recent advancements that\nhave focused specifically on LLMs, numerous techniques have\nbeen developed for efficiently running convolutional models\nand smaller scale language models such as BERT at low\nprecision [5]–[7]. However, the latter techniques have not been\nevaluated in the context of modern LLMs and vision trans-\nformers. Given the recent interest in quantization of LLMs,\nthis paper presents an open-source simulator, INT-FP-QSim1\nfor flexible evaluation of LLMs and vision transformers at\nvarious numerical formats. INT-FP-QSim combines resources\nfrom existing open-source repositories, such as TensorRT [8],\nQPytorch [9] and AIMET [10], [11] for a combined simulator\nthat enables flexible investigations with a variety of numerical\ndata formats and precisions.

How does CODAMOSA enhance test coverage and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of automated testing?,"['IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 30\ndetermine whether it passes or fails. Finally, the prompt\nrefiner applies a number of strategies to generate additional\nprompts to use for querying the model. They mainly apply\nfour strategies: 1) Include the definition of a function if the\nprompt does not contain it. 2) Include the doc comment\nif the prompt does not contain it. 3) Include the usage\nsnippets if the prompt does not contain them. 4) Include\nthe text of the failing test followed by a comment if a test\nfailed. They evaluate TestPilot on 25 npm packages from\ndiverse domains and use Istanbul/nyc to measure statement\ncoverage. Results show that the generated tests achieve up\nto 93.1% statement coverage. Besides, they discover that\nre-prompting the model with the error message of failing\ntests allows TESTPILOT to produce a consequent passing\ntest in 16.3% of the cases. They also notice that a refiner\nalways improves the results and trying all combinations of\nthe various prompt components is the best for performance\nimprovement.\n③Mutation-guided Generation. Building on the\nprogress, Dakhel et al. [174] propose MuTAP , which\nenhances the quality of test cases using LLMs, particularly\nin detecting software bugs. It guides LLMs in generating\ntest cases by combining zero-shot and few-shot learning\ntechniques and assesses their effectiveness through\nMutation Testing on the generated test cases. MuTAP also\ninvolves steps for syntax fixing and intended behavior\nrepair to ensure the generated test cases are syntactically\ncorrect and reflect the expected behavior of the program.\nIf the generated test cases fail to entirely kill all mutants,\nMuTAP introduces surviving mutants to prompt LLMs\nto generate more effective test cases. Finally, MuTAP\nincorporates an Oracle Minimization step utilizing a\ngreedy algorithm to reduce redundant assertions, aiming\nto enhance the effectiveness of test cases by minimizing\nredundant assertions and thereby improving their efficiency.\n④Conversation-driven Generation with ChatGPT. In\n2023, ChatGPT is also being applied in unit test generation.\nXie et al. [107] propose ChatUniTest, an automated unit\ntest generation tool based on ChatGPT, falling under the\n”Generation-Validation-Repair” framework. It parses the\nproject, extracts vital information, and creates an adaptive\nfocal context, including the focal method and its dependen-\ncies within the predefined maximum prompt token limit.\nThis context is incorporated into a prompt and then sub-\nmitted to ChatGPT. Upon receiving a response from Chat-\nGPT, ChatUniTest extracts the raw test from the response.\nSubsequently, it validates the test and employs rule-based\nrepair to fix syntax and simple compile errors, followed by\nusing ChatGPT for addressing challenging errors. In rigor-\nous evaluations, ChatUniTest excels, surpassing EvoSuite in\nbranch and line coverage and outperforming AthenaTest\nand A3Test in focal method coverage. ChatUniTest effec-\ntively generates assertions while utilizing mock objects and\nreflection to achieve test objectives.\n⑤Empirical Evaluations of LLM-based Test Genera-\ntion. To enhance test coverage and improve the efficiency\nand effectiveness of automated testing, Lemieux et al. [110]\npropose to leverage LLMs for SBST. They present CO-\nDAMOSA which integrates Codex with SBST to generate\nPython test cases. In each mutation iteration, CODAMOSA\nkeeps track of the coverage achieved by the current archiveand keeps a copy of the current population. If the coverage\nstall length does not surpass the ’maxStallLen’ they set,\nCODAMOSA behaves just like SBST, i.e.,, creating a set of\nmutated test cases, and updating the archive and population\nwith these mutants. If the coverage stall has reached the\nmaximum length, CODAMOSA calls the target generation\nstep, which invokes the model to generate test cases target-\ning low-coverage test objects. In the target generation step,\nthey first compute the coverage for each of the test objects\nand then query the model. They use the source code of the\nmodule under test and an appropriate form of a function\nheader as the prompt. With the test cases Codex generated,\nthey further deserialize the generated test cases into the\nsearch algorithm’s internal representation. Then, the union\nof the generated test cases and their mutants is used to\nupdate the archive and population, as in a regular SBST.\nThey evaluate CODAMOSA on Pynguin and BugsInPy\ndatasets. Results show that CODAMOSA achieves signifi-\ncantly higher coverage on many more of the benchmarks\n(173 vs MOSA, 279 vs Codex ONLY) than it reduces cover-\nage on (10 vs MOSA, 4 vs CODEXONLY). They also explore\ndifferent design decisions and find that sampling Codex\nwith a higher temperature has the most consistently positive\neffect on achieved coverage. They notice that more complex\nprompting yielded better results in some cases, but was less\nconsistent than the simple prompting. They conclude that\nfurther prompt engineering could improve results.\nMeanwhile, in 2023, Tang et al. [109] compare ChatGPT\nand the advanced SBST tool EvoSuite comprehensively.\nIn terms of correctness and execution capability, ChatGPT\nsuccessfully generates unit test cases for all 207 Java classes,\nwith 69.6% of test cases compiling and executing with-\nout manual intervention. However, some test cases have\ncompilation errors, mainly because ChatGPT doesn’t fully\nunderstand the entire project, SpotBugs detection reveals\n403 potential defects among 204 test cases, with most being\nlow-priority issues. Regarding readability, the test suite gen-\nerated by ChatGPT violates coding style conventions, espe-\ncially in terms of indentation. The study suggests improving\ncode consistency and maintainability. In code coverage,\nEvoSuite outperforms ChatGPT with an average statement\ncoverage of 74.2%, compared to ChatGPT’s 55.4%. Although\nEvoSuite generally excels, ChatGPT demonstrates advan-\ntages in 37 cases, highlighting its strengths in generating\ndiverse test data and understanding semantics. In defect\ndetection, assertions in test cases generated by ChatGPT are\ndeemed potentially unreliable, introducing some misleading\naspects. However, in an experimental comparison using\nthe Defects4J project, ChatGPT successfully identifies 44\ndefects, slightly fewer than EvoSuite’s 55. Overall, the study\nrecommends EvoSuite as the preferred tool due to its robust\nperformance in code coverage and defect detection. Nev-\nertheless, ChatGPT retains value, particularly in generating\ndiverse test data and semantic understanding, positioning\nit as a viable entry-level testing tool or alternative choice.\nCombining search-based software testing techniques with\nNLP modules holds promise for enhancing the performance\nof SBST tools, offering developers a more efficient and\nreliable software testing experience.']","CODAMOSA enhances test coverage and improves the efficiency and effectiveness of automated testing by integrating Codex with SBST to generate Python test cases.

What advantage do open-source 'white-box' language models offer in the context of the PKG framework?,"['Augmented Large Language Models with\nParametric Knowledge Guiding\nZiyang Luo1∗, Can Xu2, Pu Zhao2, Xiubo Geng2, Chongyang Tao2,\nJing Ma1,Qingwei Lin2,Daxin Jiang2†\n1Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong SAR, China\n2Microsoft Corporation\ncszyluo@comp.hkbu.edu.hk, majing@hkbu.edu.hk\n{caxu,pu.zhao,xigeng,chongyang.tao,qlin,djiang}@microsoft.com\nAbstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have signiﬁcantly advanced natural language\nprocessing (NLP) with their impressive language understanding and generation\ncapabilities. However, their performance may be suboptimal for domain-speciﬁc\ntasks that require specialized knowledge due to limited exposure to the related data.\nAdditionally, the lack of transparency of most state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, which\ncan only be accessed via APIs, impedes further ﬁne-tuning with domain custom\ndata. Moreover, providing private data to the LLMs’ owner leads to data privacy\nproblems. To address these challenges, we propose the novel Parametric Knowl-\nedge Guiding (PKG) framework, which equips LLMs with a knowledge-guiding\nmodule to access relevant knowledge without altering the LLMs’ parameters. Our\nPKG is based on open-source ""white-box"" language models, allowing ofﬂine\nmemory of any knowledge that LLMs require. We demonstrate that our PKG\nframework can enhance the performance of ""black-box"" LLMs on a range of do-\nmain knowledge-intensive tasks that require factual ( +7.9%), tabular ( +11.9%),\nmedical ( +3.0%), and multimodal ( +8.1%) knowledge.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-family [OpenAI, 2023b] have exhibited impressive\nproﬁciency across a diverse range of NLP tasks. These models are typically trained on extensive\ndata from the internet, thereby enabling them to assimilate an immense amount of implicit world\nknowledge into their parameters. As a result, LLMs have emerged as versatile tools that ﬁnd\nnumerous applications in both research and industry. For instance, they can be used for machine\ntranslation [Jiao et al., 2023], document summarization [Yang et al., 2023], and recommendation\nsystems [Gao et al., 2023]. With their exceptional language understanding and generation capabilities,\nLLMs have opened up new opportunities for diverse industrial applications, such as the recently\nlaunched New Bing [Microsoft, 2023] and ChatGPT Plugins [OpenAI, 2023a].\nDespite their impressive performance across various general tasks, LLMs may face challenges when\napplied to domain-speciﬁc tasks [Chalkidis, 2023; Kasai et al., 2023; Nascimento et al., 2023] due to\ntheir limited exposure to relevant knowledge and vocabulary. Although LLMs acquire implicit world\nknowledge during pre-training, such knowledge may be insufﬁcient or inappropriate for speciﬁc tasks,\nresulting in less effective performance. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art LLMs are considered\n""black-box"" models, accessible only through APIs.

How does MONITOR assess the factual knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs)?,"['We define the count of positive and negative infor-\nmation as one and M, respectively, corresponding\nto an object. IRD has a value between 0and1. As\npositive contextual information likely leads to fac-\ntual knowledge generation, a smaller value of IRD\nindicates a lower level of influence from in-context\ninterference biases.\n4.3 MONITOR: MOdel kNowledge\nrelIabiliTy scORe\nThe prompt-framing degree PFD and interference-\nrelevance degree IRD are integrated to produce\nthe proposed model knowledge reliability score\n(MONITOR). MONITOR captures the quadratic\ninteraction of PFD and IRD, as illustrated in Eq 3\nfor a specified number of quadruples < s, r, o, i > ,\nwhere the count of subject and object is S. A set\nof coefficients ( α1−3) is introduced to quantify the\ncontributions from PFD, IRD, and their interac-\ntion on MONITOR. In this experiment, we con-\nsider an equal contribution scenario ( α1=α2=\nα3= 0.33). The smaller the value of MONITOR,\nthe less the model is influenced by hallucination-\ninduced factors when producing factual outputs.\nTaking the average output probabilities of primary\nanchors for an LLM as the denominator, MON-\nITOR captures the degree of knowledge learned\nby an LLM when assessing its factual knowledge.\nMONITOR measures the effects of prompt framing\nand interference per unit of average primary anchor\nprobability, demonstrating the strength of anchor\nrepresentations.\nLLMs are resource-hungry even during their in-\nference phases. It is essential to ensure that an as-\nsessment metric is computation-efficient. Combin-\ning PFD, IRD, and their interaction in one metric\ncan reduce the computation cost when evaluating\nfactual reliability. Considering a relation with R\nprompt frames, M negative interference, and one\npositive interference, there are R∗Mcombinations\nrequired to compute the average accuracy (and ac-\ncuracy range). In comparison, we only require\nR+ (1 + M)combinations to obtain MONITOR.\nThe computation complexity for calculating MON-\nITOR ( O(n)) is considerably lower than that of\naccuracy ( O(n2)).\nMONITOR =PS\ncp\nα1PFD2+α2IRD2+α3PFD∗IRD\nPS\nc1\nLcPLc\nl=1P(oc|sc, r, i+)l(3)\n5 Experiments\nIn this section, we describe how to apply MON-\nITOR to assess the factual knowledge of the 12LLMs as mentioned above.\n5.1 Data Setting\nIn this section, we describe how we develop a test\ncorpus to accommodate prompts with various styles\nand in-context interference.\nExpanding Probing Prompt: Based on 16,166\n<subject, relation, object >triplets from T-REx\n(ElSahar et al., 2018), we develop QA probing\nprompts. We expand the probing prompt dataset\nby paraphrasing using GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to\ncreate seven prompt frames for each triplet. In\norder to ensure the diversity of prompts, we choose\nprompts with a similarity score (BLEU) below a\nthreshold (0.7).\nAdding In-context Interference: Based on the\nQA prompts constructed above, we create a test\ndataset to explore the effectiveness of the designed\nmetric with in-context interference biases. The\ndataset FKTC stands for “Factual Knowledge Test\nCorpus”. Following the template patterns (Tem-\nplates 4 and 5) in Table 1, we concatenate interfer-\nence information (in terms of positive and negative\nin-context information) with the probing question\nfor each subject. The negative information is enti-\nties from the same category weakly related to the\ncorresponding subject, sampled from all objects\nthat share the same relation.

An example question is\n“Where is the Thames River located?” to which the\ncorrect answer is London . To simplify the evalua-\ntion, and avoid the issue of extracting answers from\nChatGPT’s often verbose responses, we manually\nconverted 50 randomly selected instances into the\nmultiple-choice format used by CommonsenseQA.\nTo create plausible incorrect answers ( distractors) ,\nwe randomly selected four incorrect candidate an-\nswers from sets of world city names3and celebrity\nnames4(correct answers in this dataset are all ei-\nther city names or celebrity names).

What potential issue may arise in LLMs due to the lack of tool usage awareness?,"['plored in LLMs by Ullman (2023) and Kosinski\n(2023). Huang et al. (2023) highlighted that the\nlack of tool usage awareness in LLMs may lead to\npotential hallucination issues (Zhang et al., 2023a;\nLi et al., 2023b). Sun et al. (2024) considered emo-\ntion awareness a trustworthy topic in LLMs and\nLi et al. (2023a) finds that incorporating emotions\ninto prompts can enhance the utility of LLMs.\nHuman-AI Collaboration for Dataset Cre-\nation. The impressive language generation abil-\nity of LLMs has streamlined the dataset construc-\ntion process, enhancing efficiency and reducing\nthe need for extensive manual efforts. Schick and\nSchütze (2021) introduced an effective method\nfor generating datasets by utilizing pre-trained\nlanguage models. Li et al. (2023c) developed\nCoAnnotating , a strategic framework that facil-\nitates human-AI collaboration through uncertainty-\nguided work allocation. In addition, Jeronymo et al.\n(2023) and Bonifacio et al. (2022) have demon-\nstrated the use of LLMs in improving datasets for\ninformation retrieval systems.\n3 Awareness in LLMs\nIn this section, we draw inspiration from psycho-\nlogical and philosophical research and present a\ncategorization of awareness for LLMs. DeGrazia\n(2009) classified self-awareness into three types:\nbodily, introspective, and social self-awareness.\nBodily self-awareness involves proprioception and\nsensation, including the experience of owning a\nbody, the perception of visceral signals, and feel-\ning the body in space (Blanke, 2012; Berlucchi\nand Aglioti, 2010; Legrand, 2006). Introspective\nself-awareness is concerned with the sense of iden-\ntities, desires, and beliefs of the self. Social self-\nawareness refers to the ability to consider the per-\nspectives of other social entities and apply that un-\nderstanding to interactions with them. According\nto this taxonomy, we suggest applying similar no-\ntions to the awareness of LLMs, categorizing it into\ntwo crucial aspects: introspective awareness and\nsocial awareness. We would not consider bodily\nawareness because LLMs do not have embodied\nexperience. In the following, we will articulate\neach type of awareness.\n3.1 Introspective Awareness\nThe idea of introspection can be traced back to\nPlato’s inquiry “...Why should we not calmly and\npatiently review our thoughts, and thoroughlyexamine and see what these appearances in us\nare?” (Plato, n.d.b) This introspective practice is\ncrucial for individuals to dissect their feelings and\nthoughts, guiding them in accomplishing their mis-\nsions. Most introspection studies have mainly fo-\ncused on humans, and there has been limited ex-\nploration into whether introspection exists in non-\nhuman entities like animals and AI (Browning and\nVeit, 2023). In this paper, motivated by the intro-\nspection in human cognition, we extend introspec-\ntive awareness to LLMs and consider it to be the\ncapability of these language models to perceive and\nunderstand their functionalities and motivations.\nFollowing this notion, we include two dimensions\nof introspective awareness: capability awareness\nand mission awareness.\nCapability Awareness. Understanding the bound-\naries of one’s knowledge and abilities is considered\nan essential element of wisdom (Plato, n.d.a). The\nsignificance of capability awareness can be also ex-\nplained by the Dunning-Kruger Effect (Kruger and\nDunning, 1999), a cognitive bias in which people\nmistakenly overestimate their knowledge or capa-\nbility in a specific field. It causes the double curse\nthat one does not perform well and does not realize\ntheir capabilities, making them unlikely to improve\nand learn (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). It is also\nimportant for LLMs to have capability awareness\nto provide honest and accurate responses. LLMs\ncannot respond to queries entailing real-time in-\nformation retrieval, generating contents in modali-\nties beyond text, and conducting physical actions.\nNamely, requests of these kinds are out of capabil-\nities or beyond the scope of knowledge of LLMs.\nTherefore, this aspect of introspective awareness as-\nsists LLMs in avoiding hallucinations and maintain-\ning the integrity of responses (Yang et al., 2023).\nMission Awareness. With the rapid advancement\nof AI capabilities, there is growing concern among\nhumans about the ethical implications of artifi-\ncial intelligence (Zhan et al., 2023). LLMs have\nreached a functional moral stage in which the ma-\nchine can respond to ethical challenges, yet it is\nnot fully capable of making ethical decisions on its\nown (Wallach and Allen, 2008). LLMs, as virtual\nassistants that have increasing interactions with hu-\nmans, are expected to be aware of their mission to\nserve human beings. Ethics Guidelines for Trust-\nworthy AI underlines AI is not an end in itself, but\nrather a promising means to increase human flour-\nishing (AI, 2019). As such, it is critical to evaluate']",The lack of tool usage awareness in LLMs may lead to potential hallucination issues.,simple,"[{'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2401.17882v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2401.17882v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1221447, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

How can student-centric guidelines improve LLM literacy?,"['Guiding Students in Using LLMs 5\n2.2 Leveraging Guidance Strategies to Steer Interactions Toward Learning\nIn tandem with investigating learner-LLM interactions, we also need to understand how to guide\nstudents in ways that support their learning instead of impeding it. Guidance plays a crucial role\nin helping users navigate how to best interact with chatbots, but the efficacy of specific forms of\nguidance remains underexplored [102].\nThe CSCW community have begun exploring different facets of this important space. For example,\nWu et al. [ 102] studied user preferences for two different guidance types (Example-Based and Rule-\nBased) at four different guidance timings (Service- Onboarding, Task-Intro, After-Failure, and Upon-\nRequest) based on data from 24 participants, and found that users preferred Example-Based guidance,\nand wanted to see the guidance as part of the Task-Intro. Zhu et al. [ 109] built a chatbot prototype\nthat provided task-based instructions to novice workers, and offered results from a pilot study with\n7 participants that indicated that back-and-forth conversations might help novice workers follow\ninstructions, and perceive those instructions as being more actionable. Our work contributes to such\nliterature on how different guidance strategies impact learner perceptions and interactions with\nLLM-based chatbots. A distinguishing feature of our work from existing preliminary studies is that\nwe deployed our experiments two distinct learner groups with comparatively larger sample sizes\n(145 students in an undergraduate CS classroom, and 356 crowdworkers from Prolific). We study\nthe specific effects of four guidance strategies (providing instructions, presenting examples, using\nmetacognitive questioning, and encouraging initial problem-solving with subsequent refinement)\nTo inform our selection of guidance strategies, in addition to looking at the types of guidance\nthat have been explored in preliminary work within the CSCW community, we also consulted\nprior pedagogical literature on various forms of instructional guidance [ 15], and chose to study\ndirect instruction [ 98], example-based instruction [ 101], and metacognitive strategies [ 64,86]—such\nas posing reflective questions [ 8,36], owing to their documented effectiveness in prior research\n[6, 10, 17, 41, 75, 94, 106].\nTo understand why guidance is of particular relevance to LLM-based chatbot design, we can\nturn to recent research on chatbot interactions of novice AI users that show prompt-writing\ncan be deceptively difficult. The response from LLM-based chatbots is primarily steered by text-\nbased prompts [ 103,108]. However, recent research has indicated that crafting effective prompts\nis challenging [ 105], particularly for those without a deep understanding of AI [ 5,38,105]. The\nconversation-like interface of these chatbots mimics human interaction [ 88], potentially misleading\nstudents into thinking that prompt-writing is straightforward as talking to humans [ 48]. This gap\nbetween perceived simplicity and the actual complexity of effective prompt-writing can breed\noverconfidence. Yet, when the chatbot fails to respond as expected, students’ trust in the AI system\n[31] can wane, leading to frustration [ 77]. In response to these challenges, informal communities\nlike the r/aipromptprogramming and r/ChatGPT subreddits have emerged to share best practices for\nprompt-writing. Simultaneously, researchers are starting to establish formal guidelines [ 32,35,63],\nbut given the nascent nature of this field, much is left to be explored. To enhance student success\nwith LLMs, there is a need to convert these guidelines into a more digestible format, thereby\nimproving LLM literacy [104, 105].\nThis paper delves into the creation of these student-centric guidelines, rendering them into clear\ninstructions for LLM use. More specifically, we evaluate how various guidance strategies—including\ndirect instruction, example-based teaching, metacognitive questioning, and worked examples—affect\nstudents’ performance, self-confidence, trust in the chatbot, and their perceptions of its efficacy.\n, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: January 2023.', 'Guiding Students in Using LLMs 7\nthese intricate relationships is key for educators, designers, and policymakers who want to harness\nthe full potential of LLMs in the learning environment.\n3.1 Guidance Strategies for LLM Engagement\nIn Section 2.2, we discussed how our guidance strategies drew insights from previous work in the\npedagogical literature [ 6,10,15,17,41,75,94,106]. In this section, we revisit some of those insights\nand describe the specifics of our design and the rationale behind each guidance strategy. Figure 1\nshows the format of each guidance strategy used in our study.\nG1: List of Suggestions We devised a set of suggestions for LLM chatbot use, as depicted in Figure\n1A. Given the limited existing research on LLM guidance for students, our suggestions drew\nfrom prominent online sources [ 69,71,76]. Recognizing the growing classroom trend of\nprescribed LLM instructions [ 4,70], G1 serves as a representative model for evaluating its\nefficacy against other guidance strategies.\nG2: Example-based instruction Leveraging examples is an intuitive approach to tool introduc-\ntion [ 59]. However, the choice of examples plays a crucial role. For our classroom deploy-\nment, we took examples of interactions from previous interview studies with students\n[REDACTED ]. These examples, validated by an instructor and a teaching assistant, show-\ncased interactions where students found the LLM beneficial. Participants were presented\nwith two such exemplary interactions, as illustrated in Figure 1B.\nG3: Metacognitive questioning (making learners think about their use of LLMs before actual\nuse). Framing the initial question effectively is crucial when seeking help, more so with LLM\nchat tools where the initial query shapes subsequent responses [ 28,105]. To enable this skill,\nparticipants were presented with an example problem and prompted to draft their opening\nquestion to the LLM chatbot. Subsequently, they reflected on the potential benefits of their\nchosen approach (Figure 1C).\nG4: Solve then refine with LLM Worked examples, step-by-step illustrations of the process re-\nquired to complete a task, are established effective learning tools [ 90]. In this multistep\nstrategy, we first ask the students to solve a problem and provide the solution. They then\nengaged with the LLM chatbot to refine their initial answers (Figure 1D).\n3.2 Approaches to Leverage LLMs in Problem Solving\nThe manner in which students engage with LLM-based tools is often influenced by the guidance or\ninstructions they receive. The sequence—whether students consult the LLM first or try to solve\nproblems on their own—has implications for both their learning process and the effectiveness of\nthe LLM as a tool. This builds on research in ""when"" is it better to provide hints for learning [79].\nLLM-First Approach (LFA): Students begin by seeking input from the LLM. This approach\ncan assist those who need a foundation or direction before delving into problem-solving, ensuring\nthey are on the right track from the onset. However, it may also promote dependency on the LLM,\npotentially limiting independent problem-solving capabilities.\nSelf-First Approach (SFA): Students first attempt to solve the problem independently and\nthen consult the LLM for refinements. This method promotes independent thinking and can boost\nconfidence in one’s problem-solving abilities. The LLM acts as a secondary check, reinforcing\ncorrect methodologies or suggesting improvements. Conversely, there might be a risk that students\nget stuck or frustrated if their initial attempts are misdirected.\n, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

What are the limitations of using crowd-sourcing platforms for meta-evaluation?,"['or (iii) using crowd-sourcing platforms to collect\nhuman annotations (Zheng et al., 2023). However,\ndue to the lack of coverage in existing datasets\nand annotation budgets, both (i) and (ii) are in-\nherently limited in their comprehensiveness. (iii)\ncan provide more comprehensive meta-evaluation\nvia crowd-sourcing, but the amount of human an-\nnotation required in the meta-evaluation process\nlimits the scalability of the approach, and crowd\nworkers may not be particularly accurate at more\ncomplex tasks. To address these issues, we propose\nan agent-debate-assisted meta-evaluation approach\nto mitigate this effort.\n3 Preliminaries\nIn this section, we provide an introduction to\nthe concepts of automatic evaluation and meta-\nevaluation systems, particularly focused on evalua-\ntion of LLM-generated outputs in the era of gener-\native AI.\n3.1 Key Terms\nWe first define some key terms that will be used\nthroughout our paper.\n•Criterion: A criterion defines a standard that\nmeasures the quality of the response generated\nby LLMs based on the user prompt. Some ex-\namples include: helpfulness, fluency, factuality,\nor creativity, among others.\n•Scenario: A scenario describes the real-world\nsituations in which users are interacting with\nLLMs. For example, brainstorming, coding, and\ndialog, among others.\n3.2 Automatic Evaluation\nAutomatic evaluation using LLMs measures the\nquality of LLM-generated responses given prompts\nunder different criteria. Usually, automatic evalu-\nation is conducted with one of two different pro-\ntocols: single-response evaluation and pairwise re-\nsponse comparison (Ouyang et al., 2022; Zheng\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a). In this paper, we\nfocus on pairwise response comparison . Pairwise\nresponse comparison is intuitive for both humans\nand LLMs as evaluators when conducting assess-\nments. It could be further extended to provide win-\nrates and Elo scores across models (Zheng et al.,\n2023), offering a straightforward leaderboard to\nunderstand the relative performance of different\nmodels under various scenarios. Formally, given\nan automatic evaluation metric E, a user-definedevaluation criterion c(e.g. helpfulness, reasoning,\ncreativity), a user prompt p, and responses gener-\nated by two systems r1, r2, evaluation for pairwise\nresponse comparison is done in the following way:\no=E(c, p, r 1, r2). (1)\no∈ {1,0,−1}represents that r1is better, equal, or\nworse than r2, respectively, given the user prompt\npunder criterion c.\n3.3 Meta-Evaluation\nMeta-evaluation assesses the quality of an auto-\nmatic evaluation metric. Formally, we define a\ngold-standard evaluation metric G(e.g. human ex-\nperts) that other automatic metrics should aspire to\nmatch. In pairwise response comparison, the meta-\nevaluation dataset G={G(c, pi, r1,i, r2,i)}n\ni=1\ncontains user prompts and corresponding responses\nfrom two systems, annotated with gold-standard\nevaluations. The meta-evaluation process assesses\nthe performance META (E)of the automatic evalu-\nation metric Eunder a certain criterion c.\nIn pairwise response comparison, the meta-\nevaluation measures the example-level agreement\nrateor the system-level agreement rate between E\nandGacross the meta-evaluation dataset. A high\nagreement rate between EandGrepresents that E\nis a good automatic evaluation metric.\nFor the example-level agreement rate , we calcu-\nlate:\nMETA (E) =1\nnnX\ni=1δE(c,pi,r1,i,r2,i),G(c,pi,r1,i,r2,i),\n(2)\nwhere 0≤META (E)≤1, and δ·,·refers to the\nKronecker delta function.\nFor the system-level agreement rate , given\nthatE={E(c, pi, r1,i, r2,i)}n\ni=1andG=\n{G(c, pi, r1,i, r2,i)}n\ni=1, we calculate:\nMETA (E) =δmode(E),mode(G), (3)\nwhere META (E)∈ {0,1},δ·,·refers to the Kro-\nnecker delta function, and mode( ·)refers to the\nvalue (either 1,0,−1in this case) that appears most\noften in the set EorG.\n4 Methodology\nIn this section, we detail the frameworks that\nSCALE EVAL employs for meta-evaluation, eval-\nuation, and human expert meta-meta evaluation.']","The limitations of using crowd-sourcing platforms for meta-evaluation include the amount of human annotation required, which limits the scalability of the approach, and the potential inaccuracy of crowd workers at more complex tasks.",simple,"[{'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2401.16788v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2401.16788v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 812302, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How does the representativeness heuristic relate to the cognitive processes of Easterners and Westerners when processing information and making judgments?,"[""as the anchoring effect, the representativeness heuristic, and the base rate neglect (Talboy & Fuller, 2023) . \nIn addition, cultural psychology research has shown that there are significant differences in the cognitive \nprocesses of Easterners and Westerners when processing information and making judgments (Nisbett et al., \n2001)  and that LLM consistently favors an Eastern holistic way of thinking (Jin et al., 2023) .  \nSecond, LLMs  have also been shown to characterize human groups in social interaction settings.

For example, \none study explored the potential of LLMs to serve as valid proxies for specific human subgroups in social \nscience research and found that LLMs contain information that goes far beyond superficial similarity, \nreflecting the complex interplay between ideas, attitudes, and sociocultural contexts that characterize human \nattitudes (Argyle et al., 2022) . In addition, one study has tested LLM for personality and values, and the \nresults show that their scores are all similar to those of human samples (Miotto et al., 2022) .  \nTherefore, LLMs  have many  applications in social and cultural psychology, allowing one  to test theories \nand hypotheses about human behavior in social and cultural interaction settings. For example, one study \nexplores whether an AI chatbot can adapt its financial decisions and pro -social behaviors through emotional \ncues as humans do (Yukun et al., 2023) . The experimental design is divided into two parts: Study 1, \ninvestment decision -making, was chosen as the topic for this study because human investment decisions are \nsusceptible to emotional cues. It is hypothesized that the investment risk -taking behavi or of AI chatbots will \nbe lower than that of the control group when they receive fear emotional cues and higher than that of the \ncontrol group when they receive joy emotional cues. By providing the bots with different emotional cues \n(fear, joy, or no emoti on), their responses in terms of investment decisions were collected and analyzed. \nStudy 2 measured the pro -social responses exhibited by an AI chatbot by providing it with emotional cues \nof anxiety and joy by donating money to a sick friend. Similar to St udy 1, whether emotional cues influenced \nits pro -social behavior was explored by collecting and analyzing the robot's responses under different \nemotional cues.

How does the length of soft prompts impact the performance of frozen LLMs?,"['performance of both tasks improves, indicating that larger LLMs have better transfer learning ability for cross-institution applications.  One potential reason is that prompting with unfrozen LLMs will potentially overfit the pretrained model to the training data of a specific institution, whereas prompting with frozen LLMs could keep the generalizability of LLMs to better support cross-institution applications. Our study also demonstrates that soft prompting with frozen LLMs has better few-shot learning performance outperforming traditional pre-training/finetuning and prompting with unfrozen LLMs when the LLMs have over billions of parameters.  Our results show that the few-shot learning and the transfer learning are associated with the size of the model as larger LLMs have more parameters to better deal with unseen samples.  We conducted an error analysis to compare soft prompting with hard prompting and pretraining/fine-tuning and discovered that soft prompting performs better for overlapped or nested concepts and their relations.  For example, the soft prompting using unfrozen GatorTron-345M identified 39% and 82% of the overlapped/nested concepts, outperforming the corresponding GatorTron-345M model trained using traditional pre-training/fine-tuning, which only accurately identified 28% and 9%, respectively.  We also examined how the length of the soft prompts affect the performance. Figure 5 compares the performance of GatorTron-3.9B model using soft prompts with different lengths (8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) using the 2022 n2c2 SDoH dataset.

What are some methods used to enhance large language models (LLMs) for KG-to-text generation?,"['JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. ??, NO. ??, MONTH 20YY 17\nBrarck Obama\nPoliticianOf\nUSAHonolulu\nBornIn\nLocatedIn\nCapitalOf\nWashingto\nD.C.MarriedT o\nMichelle\nObamaLiveInKGs\nLLMsBrack Obama  is a\npolitician of  USA .

The general framework of KG-to-text generation.\ntask. As shown in Fig. 21, both works simply represent\nthe input graph as a linear traversal and find that such\na naive approach successfully outperforms many existing\nstate-of-the-art KG-to-text generation systems. Interestingly,\nRibeiro et al. [167] also find that continue pre-training could\nfurther improve model performance. However, these meth-\nods are unable to explicitly incorporate rich graph semantics\nin KGs. To enhance LLMs with KG structure information,\nJointGT [42] proposes to inject KG structure-preserving\nrepresentations into the Seq2Seq large language models.\nGiven input sub-KGs and corresponding text, JointGT first\nrepresents the KG entities and their relations as a sequence\nof tokens, then concatenate them with the textual tokens\nwhich are fed into LLM. After the standard self-attention\nmodule, JointGT then uses a pooling layer to obtain the\ncontextual semantic representations of knowledge entities\nand relations. Finally, these pooled KG representations are\nthen aggregated in another structure-aware self-attention\nlayer. JointGT also deploys additional pre-training objec-\ntives, including KG and text reconstruction tasks given\nmasked inputs, to improve the alignment between text and\ngraph information. Li et al. [168] focus on the few-shot\nscenario. It first employs a novel breadth-first search (BFS)\nstrategy to better traverse the input KG structure and feed\nthe enhanced linearized graph representations into LLMs\nfor high-quality generated outputs, then aligns the GCN-\nbased and LLM-based KG entity representation. Colas et\nal. [169] first transform the graph into its appropriate repre-\nsentation before linearizing the graph. Next, each KG node\nis encoded via a global attention mechanism, followed by\na graph-aware attention module, ultimately being decoded\ninto a sequence of tokens. Different from these works, KG-\nBART [37] keeps the structure of KGs and leverages the\ngraph attention to aggregate the rich concept semantics in\nthe sub-KG, which enhances the model generalization on\nunseen concept sets.\n5.4.2 Constructing large weakly KG-text aligned Corpus\nAlthough LLMs have achieved remarkable empirical suc-\ncess, their unsupervised pre-training objectives are not nec-\nessarily aligned well with the task of KG-to-text genera-\ntion, motivating researchers to develop large-scale KG-text\naligned corpus. Jin et al. [170] propose a 1.3M unsupervised\nKG-to-graph training data from Wikipedia. Specifically, they\nfirst detect the entities appearing in the text via hyperlinks\nand named entity detectors, and then only add text that\nshares a common set of entities with the correspondingknowledge graph, similar to the idea of distance supervision\nin the relation extraction task [232]. They also provide a\n1,000+ human annotated KG-to-Text test data to verify the\neffectiveness of the pre-trained KG-to-Text models. Simi-\nlarly, Chen et al. [171] also propose a KG-grounded text\ncorpus collected from the English Wikidump. To ensure the\nconnection between KG and text, they only extract sentences\nwith at least two Wikipedia anchor links. Then, they use\nthe entities from those links to query their surrounding\nneighbors in WikiData and calculate the lexical overlapping\nbetween these neighbors and the original sentences. Finally,\nonly highly overlapped pairs are selected. The authors ex-\nplore both graph-based and sequence-based encoders and\nidentify their advantages in various different tasks and\nsettings.\n5.5 LLM-augmented KG Question Answering\nKnowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to find\nanswers to natural language questions based on the struc-\ntured facts stored in knowledge graphs [233], [234]. The\ninevitable challenge in KGQA is to retrieve related facts and\nextend the reasoning advantage of KGs to QA. Therefore,\nrecent studies adopt LLMs to bridge the gap between nat-\nural language questions and structured knowledge graphs\n[174], [175], [235]. The general framework of applying LLMs\nfor KGQA is illustrated in Fig. 22, where LLMs can be used\nas 1) entity/relation extractors, and 2) answer reasoners.\n5.5.1 LLMs as Entity/relation Extractors\nEntity/relation extractors are designed to identify entities\nand relationships mentioned in natural language questions\nand retrieve related facts in KGs. Given the proficiency in\nlanguage comprehension, LLMs can be effectively utilized\nfor this purpose. Lukovnikov et al. [172] are the first to uti-\nlize LLMs as classifiers for relation prediction, resulting in a\nnotable improvement in performance compared to shallow\nneural networks. Nan et al. [174] introduce two LLM-based\nKGQA frameworks that adopt LLMs to detect mentioned\nentities and relations. Then, they query the answer in KGs\nusing the extracted entity-relation pairs. QA-GNN [131]\nuses LLMs to encode the question and candidate answer\npairs, which are adopted to estimate the importance of\nrelative KG entities. The entities are retrieved to form a\nsubgraph, where an answer reasoning is conducted by a\ngraph neural network. Luo et al.

What are the strengths of commercial NMT systems in translation tasks?,"['Preprint.\nIn which scenarios do MT-oriented LLMs demonstrate superior performance, and how can we\nleverage the strengths of LLMs to enhance translation quality?\nTo begin, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of translations\ngenerated by commercial NMT systems and MT-oriented LLMs. Our findings reveal that commer-\ncial NMT systems excel at producing adequate translations in specific domains or languages. Con-\nversely, MT-oriented LLMs demonstrate proficiency in generating authentic-sounding translations\nand handling infrequent words that are not effectively processed by NMT systems. In summary,\nMT-oriented LLMs can serve as valuable fallback systems in cases where the output of commercial\nNMT systems is unsatisfactory.\nTo complement NMT with MT-oriented LLMs, recently, Hendy et al. (2023) introduced the Hybrid\nThreshold approach, which employs the NMT system as the primary translation system. When the\ntranslation fails to meet the quality threshold determined by the quality estimation (QE) module\n(e.g., COMETkiwi), the GPT is utilized to provide alternative translations. Despite its effectiveness,\nthere are still two issues: decoding latency and quality estimation. Neural language models typically\nemploy autoregressive decoding, which relies on sequential execution rather than parallel process-\ning. Due to the substantial computational requirements at each decoding step, decoding latency\nbecomes a significant concern when integrating LLMs into the translation pipeline. For quality esti-\nmation, current reference-free metrics face challenges in accurately aligning with human judgment\nat the segment level and are insufficient for distinguishing the top-performing machine translation\nsystems (Freitag et al., 2021; 2020; Ma et al., 2019; Rei et al., 2022a). Besides, their inclusion in\nthe cascaded framework can introduce additional complexity, which needs to be used with caution\nin industrial applications.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we propose a method called Cooperative Decoding (CoDec).\nIn CoDec, the NMT system functions as the front-end module, generating an initial translation draft\nfor a given input sentence. Subsequently, the MT-oriented LLM serves as an evaluator and evaluates\nthe draft from a language modeling perspective. Specifically, the LLM refines the partial translation\nstarting from a specific position where the token in the draft is not among the top-K token candidates\nsuggested by the LLM. Since the evaluation process takes advantage of parallel computation and the\nfront-end module can handle most situations effectively, CoDec is more efficient compared to using\nLLMs for complete decoding.\nWe evaluate the performance of CoDec on the WMT22 test sets and a newly collected test set, named\nWebCrawl, aiming to assess its performance in more practical scenarios. We also incorporate CoDec\ninto the hybrid threshold pipeline (Hendy et al., 2023) as a comparative system, named CoDec(QE),\nand demonstrate its superiority over the original pipeline. Interestingly, CoDec, without the need\nfor an additional quality estimation module, achieves competitive or even better performance than\nCoDec(QE). Furthermore, CoDec offers a significant acceleration advantage, achieving an acceler-\nation ratio of approximately 2x compared to directly using MT-oriented LLMs for generation. This\nefficiency improvement is particularly valuable in practical applications, where fast response times\ncan greatly enhance productivity and user experience. Overall, the evaluation results validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of CoDec, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for combining\nNMT systems with MT-oriented LLMs in machine translation1.\n2 P RELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS\nAiming to draw a better picture of the strengths and weaknesses of both traditional NMT systems\nand MT-oriented LLMs, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand the characteristics of\ntranslations from different systems.\n2.1 S ETUP\nCommercial NMT Systems & MT-oriented LLMs. Our focus is the use of MT-oriented LLMs\nin industrial settings, and the chosen commercial NMT systems consist of Google Translate\n1We release the translations of different systems at https://github.com/lemon0830/CoDec\n2']",Commercial NMT systems excel at producing adequate translations in specific domains or languages.,simple,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2311.02851v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2311.02851v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1828699, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

To test this hy-\npothesis and to strengthen our findings, we evaluate\nthe results from the previous section in a different\nway, by classification.\nWe assume that if there is a strong enough signal\nin the text for each of the target categories in our\nstudy, then a classifier should be able to predict the\ntarget age, education level, or group from the output\ntext with some accuracy. This signal might be\nindependent or immeasurable by the features used\nin FKRE. In that case, we can accept that there areadditional, measurable differences in the text that\nare not captured by Flesch-Kincaid’s readability\nmetrics. However, note that such a classifier could\nstill not tell us exactly what those differences are.\nWe fine-tune a BERT model to classify the LLM\nresponses into the target groups we used. We use\nBERT as it captures text meaning in a broader sense\nwithout us having to define specific features. We\ndo not want to use an LLM, which we evaluate, but\na simpler model. We use 8,400 instances from each\nmodel: 6,720 for training, and 1680 for tests.

What are the challenges associated with using hard prompts in clinical NLP?,"['types of prompt shapes including (1) “hard prompts” (or discrete prompts) – a piece of text composed by researchers providing information about the target prediction, and (2) “soft prompts” (or continuous prompts) – a continuous vector (of virtual tokens) attached to the input.  To adopt LLMs for specific downstream applications, researchers either adopt the traditional fine-tuning to keep updating the pretrained LLMs – known as “model-tuning”, or to freeze the LLMs and only update the soft prompts – known as “prompt-tuning” or “p-tuning”.[6]  Most studies in clinical NLP focus on hard prompts as ChatGPT adopted this strategy and achieved a breakthrough in conversational AI.  However, designing hard prompts is very labor-intensive, and recent studies have shown that LLMs are very sensitive to hard prompts.  Therefore, many recent studies started exploring prompt-tuning using soft prompts. Prompt-tuning offers many benefits over model-tuning, especially in reducing the computing and memory costs as LLMs are frozen during the fine-tuning.  Another important benefit of freezing LLMs in prompt-tuning is that we can deploy one single LLM for multiple tasks in the real-world healthcare applications.  However, early-stage studies on prompt-tuning using smaller LLMs have shown that freezing LLMs often does not yield good performance that is competitive with model-tuning.  Most recently, several studies further explored prompt-tuning and demonstrated promising results by scaling up the model size to exceed billions of parameters.   LLMs have many potentials in medical research and healthcare.  An important application of clinical NLP is patient information extraction from clinical narratives. Clinical concept extraction (or named entity recognition [NER]) and relation extraction (RE) are two fundamental NLP tasks for patient information extraction.[7]  Various solutions, including rule-based [8–10]  traditional machine learning-based models, [11–14] and deep learning model [15–17] have been developed ']","Designing hard prompts is very labor-intensive, and recent studies have shown that LLMs are very sensitive to hard prompts.",simple,"[{'page_label': '7', 'file_name': '2310.06239v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.06239v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1168573, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

Comparing the behavior of the decider in\nthis setting (Player 1) with the behavior of the decider in\nthe Classical Ultimatum (Player 2), we expect that if GPT-4\ngeneralizes the rule of “accept any offer with payoff greater\nthan zero”, a similar distribution of acceptance probabilities\nas before should be observed. However, as seen in Figure\n9 (Orange), the distribution changed drastically despite the\nexpected rational strategy being the same. In particular, the\nprobability of Player 1 acceptance in the 3 Turn Ultimatum\nis proportional to the degree of perceived fairness of the\nproposal (i.e., acceptance decreases as the amount Player 1\noffered decreases). This result suggests that while GPT-4\nhas learned the rational actions to take in the classic Ultima-\ntum game, it does not fully generalize this rational strategy\nwhen the game scenario changes.\nThe available amount to split changes the final split dis-\ntribution. We explore behavioral changes when the amount\nof money the two agents have to split is increased. In Fig-\nure 10 we show the percentage of the total sum that ul-\ntimately goes to Player 1 on average.

For example, when\nsplitting $10,000,000,000, Player 1 obtains almost 79% of\nthe amount. An interesting bias for the decider is observed:\nthe decider might be willing to accept large sums of money\nright away even if they are not fair splits. This result reveals\nthat the strategies and decision-making of LLMs are sen-\nsitive to the absolute amounts available in the game, even\nthough the rational strategy should remain the same.

(2023) and Guo (2023) studied\nthe behavior of LLMs in the Repeated Ultimatum Game\nwhereas Aher et al. (2022) used the Ultimatum Game to\nsee whether LLMs can simulate human behavior. Fu et al.\n(2023) looked at improving LLM capabilities in buyer-seller\nnegotiation games through self-play and in-context learning.\nMeanwhile, Schneider et al. (2023) sought to understand the\ninteraction between LLMs and humans in price negotiations\nonly. Guo et al. developed an LLM-based agent to play im-\nperfect information games. In contrast, we study the rational\ncapacities of LLMs as it is, without any learning, focusing\non LLM behavior when pitted against each other in a range\nof multi-turn, single-shot games. Bakhtin et al. (2022) devel-\noped an AI system to play Diplomacy, which requires a very\nspecific type of negotiation with human players. In compar-\nison, NEGOTIATION ARENA is designed as an open-source\nplatform to study diverse types of LLM-LLM negotiations.\nRecent and concurrent work provides a very valuable analy-\nsis using a similar negotiation framework (Davidson et al.,\n2024); between the two frameworks there are some techni-\ncal differences (in how communication and messaging are\ndefined) and some conceptual differences (in how payoffs\nand goals are given to agents); in our analysis, we delve\ndeeper into social patterns and investigate irrational behav-\niors that affect LLMs negotiation, while Davidson et al.\n(2024) also explore faithfulness and instruction following\nbehavior. Ultimately we believe that both papers have two\ncomplementary, though different, approaches to study and\nsolve the complex problem of tackling evaluation and model\nunderstanding with the use of negotiation.\n7. Discussion\nWe develop NEGOTIATION ARENA , a flexible open-source\nplatform to study negotiation behavior between LLMs.\nAcross multiple scenarios, we show that while GPT-4 tends\nto be the best negotiating LLM, all the models exhibit inter-\nesting biases and limitations. In particular, social behaviors\nsuch as pretending to be desperate or using insults can sig-\nnificantly improve the agent’s payout. The LLM agents\nare also prone to anchoring and numerosity biases. Un-\nderstanding these irrational behaviors and vulnerabilities is\nimportant to making LLM agents more reliable. We believe\nNEGOTIATION ARENA can be a useful new framework to\nevaluate LLM interactions and a resource to the community.\n8']","The amount of money available to split affects LLM decision-making in negotiation scenarios by influencing the final split distribution. As the available amount to split increases, Player 1 tends to obtain a larger fraction of the total sum. For example, when splitting $10,000,000,000, Player 1 obtains almost 79% of the amount. This indicates that LLMs are sensitive to the absolute amounts available in the game, and the decider might be willing to accept large sums of money right away even if they are not fair splits.",simple,"[{'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '2402.05863v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.05863v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1384665, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

How did the implementation of the Find Step in the Find-Fix-Verify process affect the LLM's prioritization of issues?,"['tioned HumorTool case, integrating results from\ntoo many sub-tasks may lead to certain options\ndominating others, e.g., the LLM can “focus on\nturning the joke into being sarcastic, which can\ntake away the humor from the joke” (P5). Simi-\nlarly, P14 (in Find-Fix-Verify ) implemented their\nFind Step (Figure 2) to simultaneous searching\nfor multiple issues, which led the LLM to priori-\ntize spelling errors and miss wordiness problems.\nOverall, explicitly stating the top criteria seem\nimportant for LLMs.\nLLMs are more sensitive to comparison-based\nthan humans. As prior work has observed,\nLLMs are still sensitive to minor paraphrases ( e.g.,\nP7 in Find-Fix-Verify prototyped di fferent wordings\namong “fragment”, “clauses”, “substrings” etc. in\ntheir prompt). However, on the flip side, LLMs are\nquite responsive to comparison-based instructions.\nWe will use Iterative Process for illustration. In its\noriginal design, Little et al. (2010) reported anchor-\ning bias to be an inherent limitation of the pipeline:\n“perhaps owing to the fact that crowdworkers will it-\nerate & improve upon existing ideas, the variance is\nlower.” All three students replicating this pipeline\nmade similar observations but also found that such\nbias could be mitigated just with straightforward\ninstructions. For example, P11 initially observed\nthat the pipeline “tends to converge on a specific\ntheme” , but was able to redirect the model with a\nsimple prompt: “The following ideas are examples\nof low quality, please avoid these common pitfalls.”\nSimilarly, P3 was pleasantly surprised by how ef-\nfective it is to simply “ask for outputs that di ffer\nfrom the initial set” —“I was originally concerned\nthat providing examples would ‘prime’ the model\nto generate only examples in the same format, but\nit seems that this is not an issue in practice. ” Note\nthat such simple instructions are unlikely to work\nfor crowdworkers who are trapped by their personal\nbiases (Wu et al., 2021).\nThis sensitivity to adjectives such as “di fferent”\nand “diverse” warrants further exploration. One\npeer grader highlighted this by suggesting, “If\nwe’re allowed to make suggestions, we could ask\nfor titles that are happier, more obtuse, and fun-\nnier, which goes beyond traditional crowdsourc-\ning methods. ” This suggestion aligns with exist-\ning prompting techniques like Self-Refine (Madaan\net al., 2023), where LLMs critique their own out-\nputs to generate improved versions focusing on\nspecific dimensions.Reflection: Examine e ffects of instruction tun-\ning, and train humans for complementarity.\nWhile di fferences between humans and LLMs are\nexpected, it is interesting how some of these dispar-\nities arise from the goal of training LLMs to mimic\nhuman behavior. For example, methods like Rein-\nforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF\nOuyang et al., 2022) use human preferences to en-\nhance LLMs’ ability to follow instructions. This\nmight have simultaneously enabled LLMs to iter-\nate on content based on abstract comparison com-\nmands more e ffectively than humans , who often get\ntrapped by cognitive bias or struggle with ambigu-\nous or vague instructions (Gershman et al., 2015).\nThat said, it is unclear whether LLM generations\nare always better in these cases, as these models\nare also biased by their training and can have po-\nlarized stands (Jiang et al., 2022; Santurkar et al.,\n2023).\nBranching out from this observation, it would be\ninteresting to explore potential “side-e ffects” of the\nLLM training schema. Prior work has highlighted\nthe trade-o ffbetween few-shot vs. zero-shot ca-\npabilities and the need to train LLMs with multi-\nfaceted human feedback (Wu et al., 2023). Consid-\nering LLMs’ need for explicit information foraging,\nanother worthy line of investigation would be the\ncompleteness and clarity of instructions. As most\nexisting instruction tuning datasets prioritize high-\nquality and precise instructions (Longpre et al.,\n2023), it remains unclear how LLMs would re-\nspond to ill-defined prompts or instructions contain-\ning irrelevant information. It might be interesting to\nexamine how LLMs can be trained using a “chain-\nof-instruction-clarification” approach, similar to\nthe back-and-forth dialogues employed by humans\nto elicit design requirements. For instance, incor-\nporating a sub-task that involves humans clarifying\nthe top criteria could potentially enhance LLMs’\nability to handle multiple requirements e ffectively.\nThe split of strengths also calls for human-LLM\ncomplementarity . Instead of humans or LLMs com-\npleting all sub-tasks, an e ffective task delegation\namong a mixture of di fferent “workers” might be\nuseful. For example, P15 in HumorTool noticed the\npartial e ffectiveness of their LLM chain: It excelled\nat“extracting relevant attributes of a news head-\nline and brainstorming associated concepts” but\nfailed at translating them into actual jokes. As such,\nexplicitly training humans to identify and develop\nskills complementary to LLM strengths could be an']",The implementation of the Find Step in the Find-Fix-Verify process led the LLM to prioritize spelling errors and miss wordiness problems.,simple,"[{'page_label': '9', 'file_name': '2307.10168v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2307.10168v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1432220, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

"What issue arises when using C-Density-based selection for node annotation, and how can it be mitigated?","['Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nK-Medoids algorithm (Wu et al., 2019), integrating it with difficulty-aware active selections is not\nfeasible. For loss functions, we consider both cross entropy loss and weighted cross entropy loss,\nwhere we add a “-W” postfix for the latter. Detailed introductions of these methods are shown in\nAppendix A. The results for GCN are shown in Table 2. In terms of space limits, we move part of\nthe results and more ablation studies to Appendix J.\nFrom the experimental results, we make the following observations:\n1. The proposed post-filtering strategy presents promising effectiveness. Combined with traditional\ngraph active learning methods like GraphPart, RIM, and Featprop, it can consistently outperform.\nCombined with FeatProp, it can achieve both promising accuracy and better scalability.\n2. Although C-Density-based selection can achieve superior annotation quality, merely using this\nmetric will make the trained model achieve poor performance. To better understand this phe-\nnomenon, we check the labels of the selected nodes. We find that the problem lies in label\nimbalance brought by active selection. For example, we check the selected nodes for P UBMED ,\nand find that all annotations belong to one class. We further find that tuning the number of clus-\ntering centers for C-Density can trade off between diversity and annotation quality, where a larger\nKcan mitigate the class imbalance problem.

We make comparison\nwith a wide variety of baseline methods, including\nthe representative dense retrievers based on pre-\ntrained language models, e.g., ANCE (Xiong et al.,\n2020), RocketQA (Ren et al., 2021), GTR (Ni et al.,\n2021), RetroMAE (Liu and Shao, 2022), SimLM\n(Wang et al., 2022a), and the conventional BM25-based sparse retriever (Lin et al., 2021). We also\nintroduce the latest methods leveraging LLMs as\nthe backbone encoder, including CPT (Neelakan-\ntan et al., 2022), SGPT (Muennighoff, 2022), Re-\npLLaMA (Ma et al., 2023).\nThe primary observations are presented as fol-\nlows. First of all, LLaRA achieves the top re-\ntrieval performance in every evaluation scenario.\nRemarkably, it results in a MRR@10 of 43.1\non MS MARCO passage retrieval, a MRR@100\nof 47.5 on document retrieval, and an average\nNDCG@10 of 55.1. Such performances are even\nhigher than most of the re-ranking results from\nthe cross-encoders (Zhuang et al., 2023; Nogueira\net al., 2019; Thakur et al., 2021). Besides, com-\npared with its closest baseline, RepLLaMA (mak-\ning direct use of LLaMA while following the\nsame fine-tuning recipe), LLaRA leads to +1.9%\nof MRR@10 on MS MARCO passage retrieval,\n+1.9% of MRR@100 on MS MARCO document\nretrieval, and +1.0% of NDCG@10 on BEIR zero-\nshot retrieval. Such notable and consistent empiri-\ncal gains validate that the LLM’s text embedding\ncapability has been substantially improved thanks\nto the adaptation from LLaRA.\nWe have the following observations for each spe-\ncific scenario.

(2023) find that LLMs have differ-\nent abilities, which results in different generation\nresults. In this work, we decouple their comprehen-\nsion and embellishment abilities to make it possible\nfor them to summarize precisely with only compre-\nhension. As shown in Figure 3, we design two in-\nstructions for the two abilities. The embellishment\ninstruction named Iemband the comprehension one\nnamed Icomare listed in Appendix B.\nBefore training, the original model does not\nknow how to meet "" consistent "" and "" inconsistent ""\ndemands and just write summaries with their strong\ngeneration capabilities. Hence, we design an In-\ncentive Loss to encourage the model to follow the\ninstructions. Given a summary Sconsists of n\nwords S= [w1, w2, ..., w n]annotated with the la-\nbel set L= [l1, l2, ..., l n], we can divide Sinto\nS+={wi|li= 1, i∈[1, n]}andS−={wj|lj=0, j∈[1, n]}.

How does the T5 model contribute to the automation of the code review process?,"['IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 42\nactivities necessitate developers to review, understand, and\nexecute code to assess logic, functionality, latency, style, and\nother factors.

They\npredominantly concentrate on enhancing code quality and\nreview efficiency through data collection and preparation,\npre-training task design, and evaluation for performance\nimprovement.\nExploration of T5 in Code Review. In 2022, Li et al. [160]\nintroduce AUGER, which uses a pre-trained T5 model to\nautomatically generate code review comments. Firstly, it col-\nlected 79,344 Java code reviews from GitHub and then built\na framework utilizing the T5 model for automatic integra-\ntion and generation of review comments. This collaborative\napproach effectively captures the relationship between code\nand review language, outperforming baseline models such\nas LSTM, COPYNET, and CodeBERT, and allows for real-\ntime feedback. The model is capable of further training and\ncovers unfamiliar programs more freely than individuals.\nAdditionally, it adopts several criteria from previous stud-\nies to assess the generated comments, providing a certain\ndegree of usefulness akin to human review comments. In\nfuture work, the paper aims to explore implementation\nwithout language differences and extend its widespread\napplication for collaborative review of new systems with\nprofessionals.\nIn parallel to AUGER [160], Tufano et al. [161] propose\nto apply a pre-trained T5 model for code review tasks.\nThey create a pre-training Java dataset including both source\ncode and technical English by collecting from two datasets\n(i.e.,, the official Stack Overflow dump and CodeSearchNet)\nand filtering out unqualified instances. To perform the pre-\ntraining, they randomly mask in each instance 15% of its\ntokens. They adopt T5-small and pre-train it with the same\nconfiguration by Raffel et al. [6]. Then, they create the fine-\ntuning dataset by mining Java open-source projects from\nGitHub and from the six Gerrit installations which contain\ncode review data. They extract triplets ¡ ms,cnl,mr¿ from\nboth datasets: a method submitted for the review, a review’s\ncomment suggesting code changes and the revised version\nof the code. They use the fine-tuning dataset for three\ndownstream tasks. In the first task (code-to-code), the model\ntakes msas input and is expected to generate mr. In the\nsecond task (code&comment-to-code), the model takes both\nmsandcnlas input and is expected to generate mr. In\nthe third task (code-to-comment), the model takes msas\ninput and is expected to generate cnl. After evaluating the\napproach on the fine-tuning dataset, they find that their\napproach outperforms the baseline model [182] and the non-\npre-trained T5 model.\nDomain LLM for Code Review. Liet al. [159] propose\nCodeReviewer, which is based on the Transformer archi-\ntecture, adopts the same structure as the T5 model, and\ninitializes it with parameters from CodeT5. CodeReviewer\nfocuses on how to use pre-training techniques to automate\nthe code review process, ensuring code quality. The authors\nstart by collecting a large dataset from open-source projects\non GitHub, covering nine programming languages, consist-\ning of code changes and code reviews. They then use this\ndataset for pre-training and subsequently for three impor-tant tasks: code change quality estimation, review comment\ngeneration, and code refinement. To enhance the model’s\nunderstanding, Li et al. design four pre-training tasks, in-\ncluding Diff Tag Prediction (DTP) task, denoising code diff\n(DCD), denoising review comment (DRC), and review com-\nment generation. These tasks aim to help the model better\nunderstand code differences and generate relevant review\ncomments. The authors categorize these tasks into classifica-\ntion and generation tasks, utilizing the pre-trained encoder\nfor the former and the entire encoder-decoder model for the\nlatter. Finally, they evaluate CodeReviewer’s performance\non both the pre-training dataset and the processed dataset,\nwith results indicating that CodeReviewer outperforms two\npreviously established pre-trained models: T5 and CodeT5-\nbase.\nExploration of ChatGPT in Code Review. Guo et\nal.[162] explore the potential of ChatGPT in automated\ncode refinement tasks through a pioneering empirical study,\nwith a specific focus on code refinement based on code\nreviews. The authors assess the impact of different Chat-\nGPT configurations on its performance across standard\ncode review benchmarks and a newly collected dataset.\nIn this empirical study, the researchers optimize param-\neter settings for ChatGPT and find that it performs ex-\nceptionally well on both the CodeReview dataset and the\nnewly constructed CodeReview-New dataset, demonstrat-\ning superior generalization capabilities. A detailed anal-\nysis reveals that ChatGPT exhibits stable performance\ncompared to CodeReviewer, particularly excelling on the\nhigh-quality CodeReview-New dataset. However, for cases\nwhere CodeReviewer performs less optimally, the re-\nsearchers identify several key root causes, including accu-\nracy in understanding review content, excessive deletions,\nadditional modifications, and difficulty in grasping foun-\ndational truths in code blocks. The study also uncovers\nchallenges faced by ChatGPT in tasks such as document\nand functionality refinement, primarily stemming from in-\nadequate domain knowledge, unclear location information,\nand ambiguities in review comments regarding changes.\nThe authors propose potential strategies for improvement,\nemphasizing the enhancement of review quality and the\nutilization of more advanced LLMs like GPT-4. Overall, this\nresearch provides insights into the potential of ChatGPT in\ncode refinement tasks and lays the foundation for future\nstudies integrating ChatGPT more deeply.\n4.4.6 Bug Report Detection\nDuplicate Bug Report Detection (DBRD) plays a crucial role\nin software development. Sometimes, when users report\nsoftware defects in issue tracking systems such as Bugzilla,\nJira, or GitHub, duplicate bug reports emerge. The task of\nDBRD is to automatically identify and label these duplicate\nbug reports, enabling developers to avoid redundantly deal-\ning with the same issues. Recognizing duplicate bug reports\nsaves time and effort for developers, thereby enhancing the\nefficiency of software development.\nIn DBRD, algorithms and methods compare and analyze\nthe similarity between different bug reports to determine if\nthey describe the same defect or problem.

There is no one\ncorrect answer, and a comprehensive judgement is required.\nby verbosity, favoring longer and more verbose texts, even if they appear wordy or of lower quality.\nWithout accounting for this bias, LLM agents may learn to generate unnecessarily long texts. This\nmay result in failures in downstream tasks such as lengthy summarizations or chatbots that return\nverbose responses to simple questions.\nWhile previous studies have explored the concept of verbosity bias, they have tended to focus on\nspecific cases. Zheng et al. (2023) limits their problem setting to questions answered with lists in\ntheir experiment on verbosity bias, and Huang et al. (2023) conducted experiments on summarization\ntasks. Moreover, these do not compare the preferences of LLMs to those of humans. We believe that\nsuch a comparison is crucial in challenging the conjecture that longer answers are inherently better\nand that LLMs are actually correct in their preferences.\nOur contributions. In this paper, we conduct experiments on verbosity bias and saw that 1) LLMs\nexhibit a preference for longer answers in creative writing tasks, and 2) there is a discrepancy between\nof LLMs and those of humans in verbosity preference. Additionally, we formulate a quantification\nfor measuring verbosity bias based on accuracy parity. This can be used to compare LLMs on their\ndegree of verbosity bias.\n2 Preliminaries\nAfter undergoing pretraining for general purposes, LLMs are fine-tuned to further improve their\nperformance in specific tasks. Pretraining is accomplished through self-supervised learning, where\nthe model is trained to predict the next token in a sentence. Once the LLM is able to generate cohesive\nsentences, we proceed to fine-tune the model to solve specific tasks. One approach to fine-tuning\ninvolves supervised learning using expert data. This method relies on examples where experts have\nsolved the task at hand. An example of a conversational LLM trained solely using this approach is\nVicuna (Chiang et al., 2023). Vicuna achieved performance comparable to ChatGPT by utilizing\nuser-shared conversations with ChatGPT as expert data. However, it is worth noting that obtaining\nexpert data is often challenging.\nRLHF addresses the challenge of limited training data in supervised learning by leveraging human\nfeedback (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). This approach not only mitigates data scarcity\nbut also significantly enhances alignment with human preferences, a critical factor in applications\nsuch as question answering. In RLHF, a reward model is trained to closely match human feedback\ndata, which acts as the reward signal in the subsequent RL phase. Prominent LLMs like ChatGPT\nand Bard adopt a hybrid approach, combining both supervised learning and RLHF techniques to\nfurther refine their alignment with human preferences.\n2""]",nan,simple,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2310.10076v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.10076v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 446221, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How do LLM-generated responses impact the validity and reliability of crowdsourcing survey datasets?,"['Wang, et al.\n7.2 Diversity of Opinions among Crowdsourcing Workers\nIn our case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of employing prompt injection to manipulate responses generated\nby LLMs, thereby pinpointing the potential misuse of LLMs in responding to crowdsourcing surveys. Nevertheless,\nit begs the question of why synthetic responses from LLMs cannot be accepted as valid inputs for crowdsourcing\nsurveys. One plausible concern is that LLMs may not replicate the diversity of opinions typically found among human\nparticipants in a crowdsourcing context.\nThe case study presented in this paper is a crowdsourcing study, designed to evaluate the influence of explanations\nprovided by intelligent agents on human decision-making. For this crowdsourcing study, we engaged 𝑁=200\nparticipants through the Prolific platform5. The participants were tasked with interacting with a chatbot simulation,\nwhich provided recommendations either with or without accompanying explanations. We discovered that participants\ndisplayed diverse opinions about the scenarios presented in Section 4. Regardless of whether a specific recommendation\nwas provided with a comprehensive explanation, at least 25% of the participants opted for alternative choices.\nOn the contrary, a distinct pattern was observed in the LLM-generated responses across all four scenarios in this study,\nin which we deliberately refrained from providing any recommendations within the survey questions. When answering\nclose-ended survey questions without the injection of attack prompts, LLM-generated responses uniformly opted for\nthe same choices: Option B for the restaurant scenario and Option A for the vacation, home energy optimization, and\nmachine repair scenarios. Simultaneously, we used the same conversational dialogue from the chatbot simulation in\nthe previous crowdsourcing study to produce responses via ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo), and all responses uniformly\nfollowed the recommendations outlined in the dialogue.\nThis, in turn, brings up the question of whether responses generated by LLMs can genuinely mirror the broad range\nof perspectives typically seen among crowdsourcing workers. Based on our current observations, the standard GPT-3.5-\nturbo API appears to fall short in replicating such diversity. Potential solutions could include tweaking parameters of\nthe GPT-3.5-turbo API to stimulate more inventive responses, such as adjusting the temperature or top P settings, as\nsuggested by OpenAI API references [ 24]. Alternatively, embedding a persona into the LLMs to guide their responses\ncould be considered. Yet, it remains uncertain how these proposed measures will enhance the diversity of LLM-generated\nresponses, thereby necessitating comprehensive assessment in future research.\n7.3 Influence of LLMs on the Trustworthiness of Crowdsourcing Surveys\nThe possibility of LLM-generated responses influencing the dataset’s validity and reliability poses a significant challenge\nfor researchers, workers, and crowdsourcing platforms. For researchers, LLMs provide a novel tool for streamlining\ndata collection processes. By leveraging these models, researchers can quickly generate pilot data or simulate responses\nfor preliminary analysis. This can support hypothesis generation and initial data modeling before deploying full-scale\nhuman-based surveys [ 13]. On the downside, the use of LLMs necessitates rigorous verification processes to ensure\ndata reliability. The capacity of LLMs to convincingly simulate human responses mandates additional controls and\nmeasures for identifying and separating LLM-generated data. The inability to distinguish these responses could lead to\nskewed results, impacting the study’s validity and undermining the reliability of findings.\nRegarding workers, the presence of LLMs could significantly impact their participation and livelihood. Given that\nLLMs can generate responses at a far higher speed than human respondents, there might be a decrease in opportunities\nfor human participants. Also, due to the current inability to effectively differentiate LLM-generated responses, more\n5https://www.prolific.co/\n18']","LLM-generated responses impact the validity and reliability of crowdsourcing survey datasets by necessitating rigorous verification processes to ensure data reliability.

How do LLMs boost object disambiguation in complex robotics and adapt to user requests?,"['LLMs for Robotic Object Disambiguation\nConnie Jiang1, Yiqing Xu2, and David Hsu2\nAbstract — The advantages of pre-trained large language\nmodels (LLMs) are apparent in a variety of language processing\ntasks. But can a LM’s knowledge be further harnessed to\neffectively disambiguate objects and navigate decision-making\nchallenges within the realm of robotics? Our study reveals the\nLLM’s aptitude for solving complex decision making challenges\nthat are often previously modeled by Partially Observable\nMarkov Decision Processes (POMDPs). A pivotal focus of our\nresearch is the object disambiguation capability of LLMs. We\ndetail the integration of an LLM into an tabletop environment\ndisambiguation task, a decision making problem where the\nrobot’s task is to discern and retrieve a user’s desired object\nfrom an arbitrarily large and complex cluster of objects. Despite\nmultiple query attempts with zero-shot prompt engineering\n(details can be found in the Appendix), the LLM struggled\nto inquire about features not explicitly provided in the scene\ndescription. In response, we have developed a few-shot prompt\nengineering system to improve the LLM’s ability to pose\ndisambiguating queries. The result is a model capable of both\nusing given features when they are available and inferring new\nrelevant features when necessary, to successfully generate and\nnavigate down a precise decision tree to the correct object—even\nwhen faced with identical options.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nPre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demon-\nstrated notable advantages in a variety of tasks, raising\nthe question of whether their capabilities can extend to\ndecision-making challenges in robotics [1]–[9]. Our research\ncenters on the object disambiguation capability of LLMs,\nparticularly within the context of tabletop environments. The\ntask is to discern and retrieve a user’s desired object from\na complex cluster of objects that can be in any arbitrary\narrangement.\nThe seemingly simple task of disambiguating an object\nfrom a scene actually involves several challenges:\n•Developing a multi-step plan for disambiguation :\nThe model must generate a sequence of questions\naimed at gathering relevant feature information. In other\nwords, the questions should be designed in a way that\nmaximizes the information gained at each step and lead\nto successful disambiguation with as few queries as\npossible.\n•Inferring new features : If the scene description pro-\nvided is insufficient in providing enough features to\nuniquely disambiguate the object, the model must be\nable to deduce potential relevant features that were not\never previously mentioned in the description.\n*This work was not supported by any organization\n1Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n2Authors are with the Smart Systems Institute, National University\nof Singapore. conniej@mit.edu, yiqing.xu@u.nus.edu,\ndyhsu@comp.nus.edu.sgPast methods of solving this task tend to either enumerate\nall possible candidates [10] or use a manually defined set\nof features to optimize information gain over time [11].\nHowever, these approaches have limitations. Enumerating\nevery possible candidate is extremely inefficient , while the\nuse of predefined features confines the model’s capability to\nrecognizing only these known features, potentially resulting\ninincomplete solutions.\nOur method overcomes the inefficiency andincompleteness\nchallenges and is capable of efficiently disambiguating any\nobject from any arbitrarily large tabletop scene by harnessing\nthe “common sense” of pre-trained LLMs with few-shot\nprompt engineering. Large language models are complete, in\nthe sense that they are not limited to pre-set features. Rather,\nthey are capable of using features that are either explicitly\nstated in the given scene description, or inferred if stated\nfeatures are not sufficient . LLMs also are significantly more\nefficient than enumeration, as they are capable of categoriz-\ning features to ask more general and effective queries.\nWe assess our model using two primary metrics: the\ncount of questions needed for successful disambiguation,\nwhich indicates efficiency , and a success rate, which reflects\ncompleteness . To better comprehend the improvement our\nmethod offers, we have set up four comparative benchmarks.\nThese include the optimal feature split, human-like disam-\nbiguation reasoning, an enumeration approach (commonly\nused in many robotic systems like INVIGORATE [10]), and\nthe latest POMDP-ATTR, which disambiguates strictly based\non color and location.\nOur findings demonstrate the LLM’s capability to navigate\ndecision trees and accurately identify the correct object, even\nwhen faced with identical options. Experimental results show\nan accuracy of 95.79% and significant improvement from\nenumeration, human performance, and POMDP-ATTR.\nII. R ELATED WORK\nDisambiguation is a key task within the scope of robotics\nand has been approached using several methods in the past\n[10]–[14]. Meanwhile, the use of LLMs in robotics is a\ngrowing field of study [1], [15]–[18]. This paper combines\nthese two areas of research.\nRegarding the task of disambiguation, the most common\napproach in robotic systems is currently enumeration, as\nevidenced in INVIGORATE and INGRESS-POMDP [10],\n[13]. In these systems, the robot points individually to\npotential target objects (chosen either heuristically or with\na POMDP) and poses a query along the lines of “Is this the\ndesired object?” This method, while effective in reducingarXiv:2401.03388v1  [cs.RO]  7 Jan 2024', 'Now, the task can be adapted to interpret and respond to\nany reasonable, generalized request (for instance, “Get me\nsomething to eat” or “Get me something to write with”). This\ndevelopment not only increases the utility of the platform\nbut also demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs\nin enriching human-robot interaction. Now, it is capable of\ninterpreting broad, nonspecific prompts, making the robotic\nsystem more user-friendly and giving it a higher level of\nresponsiveness and adaptability.\nB. Maneuvering Occluding Objects\nAfter identifying a target object, the next challenge is\nits successful delivery. This involves the non-trivial task of\nfirst relocating any objects that occlude the desired one.\n[30]–[32] From the above example, since the apple (the\ntarget object) is obscured by a toothbrush, the robot must\ninitially displace the toothbrush to successfully retrieve and\ndeliver the apple. This task was previously resolved with\na complicated POMDP [10] integrated with multiple neural\nnetwork modules specifically designed to learn the correct\ngrasping order of objects.\nIn Fig 1, we demonstrate that even without specific\ntraining (zero-shot) [27], [28], the language model proves\ncapable of competently undertaking this task. This shows\npromising results for decision-making processes in robotic\nsystems without the need for extensive, task-specific training.\nC. Disambiguation of Target Object\nUsing LLMs to disambiguate the target object is the\nprimary focus of this report. Initially, even with zero shots,\nthe model is observed to surpass the performance capabilities\nof the enumerate method. It appears, considering Fig 2,\nthat for simple scenes with few objects and features, a\nlarge language model can successfully disambiguate to any\ntarget object. With each question, the number of potential\ntarget objects is halved (four cups to two cups with the first\nquestion, and two cups to one cup with the second).\nFig. 3. Complex Scene Example. Fails with Zero-Shot Planning, but\nSucceeds with Few-Shot Prompting “There are 14 plums stacked in a\npyramid on the table. On the bottom of the pyramid is a three by three square\narrangement of 9 plums. The second layer rests on top of the bottom layer\nof 9 plums and consists of a two by two square arrangement of 4 plums.\nFinally on the top of the pyramid, there is one plum that rests on top of the\n4 plums of the second layer.”\nContrastingly, an enumerate method would have needed\nto pose four separate questions, each designed to clarifywhether a specific object is indeed the target object. For\nexample, instead of asking for the color of the target cup,\nINVIGORATE would ask if a specific cup is the desired one\n(“Do you want the cup on the left?”) [10].\nWith nrepresenting the total number of potential target\nobjects, the previous INVIGORATE’s question-asking ap-\nproach correlates with a worst-case scenario of O(n), i.e., the\nnumber of questions increases linearly with the number of\nobjects. Our model hopes to approach a logarithmic bound,\nreducing the worst-case number of questions asked, making\nit more efficient than its predecessor.\nIn Fig 2, LLMs appear capable of disambiguating in\nsimple scenes with few objects and zero-shot prompting,\nbut when pushed further, it begins to show limitations in\nits capabilities. While LLMs demonstrate proficiency in\ndisambiguating scenarios where abundant specified features\nare provided (for instance, when color, size, and classification\nare explicitly detailed in the scene description), they fall short\nin conjuring new features that are not already delineated\nin the language scene description. Take, for example, the\nscene in 3, where there is a square pyramid of 14 plums.\nWhen the user requests a plum, an ideal action plan would\ndeduce that the layer of the plum as well as the relative\nlocation within the layer could serve as a potential features to\ndistinguish among the 14 plums. Although the second feature\n(relative-location within the layer) is not explicitly stated in\nthe description, it can be reasonably inferred. Unfortunately,\ncurrent pre-trained LLMs with zero-shot prompting aren’t\nequipped to make such deductions. The model’s response in\nthis situation was:\n•Action: <ask> <“Would you like a plum from the top of\nthe pyramid, the bottom layer, or the middle layer?”>\n•Reason:“There are multiple plums and we need to\nidentify which one the human wants”\n•Action: <deliver> <specified plum>\n•Reason: “After asking questions and receiving answers,\nwe have identified the specific plum the human wants”\nAlthough logically sound, this response shows the model’s\nlimitation in inferring unspecified features. In the scene\ndescription, layer was specified (bottom, middle, top), but\nrelative location within each layer was not (top left, top\nmiddle, etc). The objective is to cultivate the use of spatial\nreferring language, or other inferred features, without their\nexplicit mention in the description.\nIV. P ROPOSED METHOD\nTo resolve this problem, we propose employing a few-shot\nprompt-engineering approach so that the LLM is capable of\ngenerating its own features. We refer the readers to Appendix\nfor the full few-shot prompts. Post few-shot prompting, our\nmethod results in a model that is now capable of producing\nboth a detailed action plan akin to those from previous\nexamples, as well as a decision tree. This decision tree visu-\nally depicts how the disambiguating questions sequentially\nnarrow down to a specific target object, demonstrating the\nprocess of honing in on the target object via one path down\nthe tree.']","LLMs boost object disambiguation in complex robotics by generating and navigating precise decision trees to identify the correct object, even when faced with identical options.

"How does CrowS-Pairs tackle social biases in LLMs, and which biases does it assess?","['Computational Linguistics\ntribution difference of a LLM in language selection based on different demographic groups. Compared\nto the social bias, unfairness is the external form, which re ﬂected in the output performance of speciﬁc\ntasks, for example, the African American English (AAE) is fr equently mis-classiﬁed as the offensive lan-\nguage by some language detector ( Lwowski et al., 2022 ). However, issues of unfairness and social bias\nare inevitable as they are widely distributed in human langu ages, and LLMs are required to memorize\nlanguage as accurately as possible in the training stage ( Weidinger et al., 2021 ). With respect to evaluate\nthis important aspect, CrowS-Pairs ( Nangia et al., 2020 ) is benchmark proposed to evaluating social bias.\nThere are 1508 examples in CrowS-Pairs that involves nine ty pes of social bias, like gender, race, and\nNationality. StereoSet ( Nadeem et al., 2021 ) is a dataset that could be used to evaluate social bias level\nin both word-level and sentence level, which examples are in four domains: race, gender,religion, and\nprofession. For the StereoSet, the bias level is computed by the difference between model generation\nprobabilities of biased and anti-biased sentence.\n2.4.3 Others\nAs current algorithms for model safety based on the human per ception, there is still no golden standard-\nized judgement for LLMs to refer to, especially when a judgem ent is highly various across societies.\nIt is necessary to align LLMs with the morality, ethics, and v alues of human society. More and more\nworks focus on reifying this abstract concept into textual d ata recently, for example, Sap et al. (2020 ) pro-\nposal an implicit reasoning frame to explain the underlying harm of the target language. Besides, other\nworks leverage rule-of-thumb (RoT) annotations of texts to support the judgement ( Forbes et al., 2020 ;\nZiems et al., 2022 ). However, current works in this area are neonatal, and we co uld expect more related\nworks in the future.\nBesides, we are also concerned about the privacy and politic al risks of LLMs. Since the LLMs are\ntrained on vast corpus collected from books, conversations , web texts and so on, the privacy safety of\nLLMs arouses people’s concern. These training texts might c ontain the private or sensitive information\nsuch as personal physical information, home address, etc. M any studies indicate LLMs are brittle under\nattacks, leaking the sensitive information unintentional ly (Carlini et al., 2020 ;Li et al., 2022 ). Therefore,\nit is essential to test the privacy protection ability of a LL M. Moreover, the politics ignorance is also\nintractable for a LLM. The politics-related risk mainly ste ms from the composition of the training corpus.\nTexts in the corpus are derived from different language and s ocial environments (usually the larger the\nmore diversiﬁed), and different countries have different p olitical prudence and stance, which brings\nadditional risks to the wide deployment of a LM.\n3 Future Directions\nIn this section, we outline some other competencies that are important for evaluating LLMs.\n3.1 Sentiment\nIt is crucial to equip LLMs with the ability to understand and generate sentiments. As an indispensable\nfactor in human life, sentiments are widely present in daily chats, social media posts, customer reviews,\nand news articles ( Liu, 2015 ). Through the comprehensive research and high-level summa ry of the liter-\nature related to sentiments, we introduce the sentiment com petency of LLMs in two aspects: sentiment\nunderstand and sentiment generation.\n3.1.1 Sentiment Understanding\nSentiment understand mainly involves the understanding of opinions, sentiments and emotions in\nthe text ( Liu, 2015 ). Representative tasks that reﬂect this competency includ e sentiment classiﬁ-\ncation (SC), aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and m ultifaceted analysis of subjective texts\n(MAST). SC aims at assigning pre-deﬁned sentiment classes t o given texts. The typical datasets\ninclude IMDB ( Maas et al., 2011 ), SST ( Socher et al., 2013 ), Twitter ( Rosenthal et al., 2017 ), Yelp\n(Zhang et al., 2015 ). ABSA focuses on identifying the sentiments of speciﬁc asp ects in a sentence\n(Zhang et al., 2022 ), and the most widely used datasets are the SemEval series ( Pontiki et al., 2014 ;\nPontiki et al., 2015 ;Pontiki et al., 2016 ).

"How do GRU, linear actor, and critic heads in CoW's Learning-based module improve RL for training SemanticNav agents in ZSON?","['IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS, VOL. 1, NO. 1, SEPTEMBER 2023 6\nlocation information.\nThe exploration module leverages depth maps and employs\ntwo modes: Learning-based and Frontier-based. The Frontier-\nbased approach is a top-down map expansion method, ini-\ntially proposed by Yamauchi et al. [80]. The Learning-based\napproach incorporates a GRU, linear actor, and critic heads.\nOverall, the CoW framework effectively repurposes zero-\nshot image classification models for popular embodied AI\ntasks. By modularizing the task into zero-shot object local-\nization and exploration, and judiciously selecting methods\nfor each component, it attains commendable success rates.\nWhile exploring deployments with user-specified targets is an\nintriguing avenue, the ultimate criterion remains real-world\nperformance.\n2)ZSON [49] introduces an innovative methodology\nfor instructing virtual robots to navigate unfamiliar ter-\nrains and identify objects without pre-existing rewards or\ndemonstrations. Distinct from conventional ObjectNav tech-\nniques, ZSON exploits image-goal navigation (ImageNav) to\ntranscode goal images into a multimodal, semantic embedding\nspace. This allows for the scalable training of semantic-goal\nnavigation (SemanticNav) agents in unannotated 3D settings.\nThe underpinning theory of ZSON hinges on the principle\nof semantic similarity. By encoding goal images as semantic\nembeddings, the approach enables agents to navigate toward\nobjects predicated on their semantic likeness to the goal\nimage. This strategy assumes that objects bearing semantic\nresemblance to the goal image are likely located in similar\nspatial contexts.\nIn the implementation phase, the first step entails using\nCLIP for pre-training to produce semantic embeddings of\nimage targets. These embeddings encapsulate intricate seman-\ntic details about the objectives. Subsequently, a SemanticNav\nagent undergoes training through reinforcement learning. The\nagent ingests egocentric RGB observations and semantic tar-\nget embeddings as input variables and utilizes a ResNet-50\nencoder along with a policy network to forecast actions.\nIn performance evaluation, the team executed extensive\nexperiments on three ObjectNav datasets: Gibson, MP3D, and\nHM3D. Their zero-shot agent recorded a 31.3% success rate\nin Gibson settings, reflecting a considerable 20.0% absolute\nuptick over earlier zero-shot benchmarks. In the MP3D dataset,\nthe agent secured a 15.3% success rate, marking a 4.2%\nabsolute enhancement vis- `a-vis existing zero-shot paradigms.\nOn the HM3D dataset, the agent’s zero-shot Success weighted\nby Path Length (SPL) paralleled that of a state-of-the-art\nObjectNav technique trained with direct guidance from 40,000\nhuman demonstrations.\nTo conclude, the approach put forth by the researchers\nyielded commendable success metrics across the three Ob-\njectNav datasets, constituting a significant divergence from\ntraditional ObjectNav strategies. The model is scalable, zero-\nshot, and well-suited for application in unannotated 3D worlds,\nestablishing it as a viable avenue for open-world ObjectNav\nimplementations.\n3)LM-Nav [66] is a navigation architecture designed for\nrobots that leverages pre-existing models specialized in lan-\nguage, vision, and action to enable sophisticated interactionswith robots via natural language commands. Remarkably, the\nsystem eliminates the need for costly supervision and fine-\ntuning, relying solely on pre-trained models for navigation,\nimage-language correlation, and language modeling. The ar-\nchitecture of LM-Nav consists of three integrated, pre-trained\nmodels to ensure precise instruction execution in complex,\nreal-world scenarios. Specifically, the system employs GPT-3\nas the LLM, tasked with decoding verbal instructions into a\nseries of textual landmarks. Concurrently, CLIP serves as the\nVLM, anchoring these textual landmarks to a topological map.\nLastly, the Vision-Action Model (V AM) is a self-supervised\nrobotic control model, responsible for utilizing visual data and\nexecuting physical actions based on plans synthesized by the\nLLM and VLM.\nImplemented on a real-world mobile robot, LM-Nav has\nbeen shown to accomplish long-horizon navigation in intricate,\noutdoor settings solely based on natural language directives.\nA salient feature is the lack of model fine-tuning; all three\ncomponent models are trained on expansive datasets with self-\nsupervised learning objectives and are deployed as-is. The\nsystem has demonstrated its ability to interpret and execute\nnatural language instructions across significant distances in\ncomplex, suburban terrain while also offering disambiguation\nin path selection through detailed commands. Such perfor-\nmance metrics underscore LM-Nav’s robust generalization ca-\npabilities and its proficiency in navigating complicated outdoor\nenvironments.\n4)CLIP-NA V [21] introduces an innovative ”zero-shot”\nnavigation framework aimed at solving coarse-grained\ninstruction-following tasks. The architecture is structured to\ndissect the guidance language into critical keyphrases, visually\nanchor them, and leverage the resulting grounding scores to\ndirect the CLIP-Nav sequence-to-sequence model in predicting\nthe agent’s subsequent actions. Initially, a keyphrase extraction\nmodule isolates salient terms from the given instructions.\nFollowing this, a visual grounding module anchors these\nkeyphrases within the environment, thereby generating a set\nof grounding scores. These scores serve as the basis for the\nsequence-to-sequence model in CLIP-Nav, which computes\nthe next set of actions based on the agent’s current state and\ngrounding scores.\nTo augment the efficacy of CLIP-Nav, the model incor-\nporates a backtracking mechanism. This allows the agent\nto retrace its steps, facilitating revisions to prior decisions.\nSuch a feature is particularly beneficial in the context of\ncoarse-grained instruction-following tasks, wherein corrective\nbacktracking may be essential.\nEvaluation metrics confirm the robustness of CLIP-Nav,\nestablishing a zero-shot baseline on the REVERIE task. Re-\nmarkably, CLIP-Nav exceeds the performance of the unseen\nsupervised baseline, even without dataset-specific fine-tuning,\nin both success rate and success weighted by path length.\nAdditionally, the paper introduces a new performance metric,\ntermed Relative Change in Success (RCS), to quantitatively\nassess generalizability in vision and language navigation tasks.\nThe RCS metric substantiates the superior performance of\nCLIP-based methodologies over conventional supervised ap-\nproaches.']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '6', 'file_name': '2311.00530v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2311.00530v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1119152, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
"How do priors and group dynamics affect LLMs' MCQA accuracy, given no memorization and artifacts?","['these prompts would best the majority baseline.\n4.2 Results\nFigure 3 shows no strong evidence that our LLMs\nmemorized the test sets, as the prompts only barely\nsurpass the majority baseline once. While impos-\nsible to rule out memorization entirely, we believe\nthat more complex strategies lead to high choices-\nonly accuracy, motivating our ensuing analyses on\nchoice dynamics (§5) and question inference (§6).\n5 Hypothesis 2: Choice Dynamics\nWith no evidence of memorization in §4, we study\nchoice dynamics in MCQA. We define two prop-\nerties of answer choices that could account for the\nLLMs’ high accuracy in choices-only prompts:\n1) Individual Priors: LLMs may learn strong pri-\nors over specific choices from in-context learning\nor pretraining. For instance, an LLM may believe a\npriori that “Albert Einstein” is often correct, or sub-\ntly that choices containing “not” are often wrong,\ninforming its decision in the choices-only setting.\n2) Group Dynamics: LLMs may also ground the\nevaluation of the correctness of a choice based on\nits relation to surrounding choices. For example, if\nan LLM is given a math question with three odd\nchoices and one even choice, the model may reason\nthat the even choice is correct, as it has distinct par-\nity. We define these processes as meta-strategies ,\nwhere the LLM reasons or makes decisions over a\ngroup of choices beyond assessing a single choice,\nsuch as inferring the original question (§6) or elim-\ninating similar options (Balepur et al., 2023).\nIn this section, we tease apart these two factors\nof choice dynamics. We first design a prompt for-\nmat that tasks LLMs with classifying the individual\ncorrectness of choices (§5.1), isolating the effect of\nindividual priors on choices-only accuracy. Next,\nwe develop a scoring system to make these binary\nclassification scores directly comparable to the ac-\ncuracy of the choices-only prompt (§5.2). Finally,\nwe assess the relation of individual priors and meta-\nstrategies to choices-only accuracy (§5.3).\n5.1 Prompt Design\nIn a full (Prompt 2.1) or choices-only (Prompt 3.1)\nprompt, the LLMs’ accuracy can be explained by\nboth individual priors and group dynamics, since\nthese prompts include all of the choices in C. To\nisolate how individual priors alone affect choices-\nonly accuracy, we prompt the LLMs to classify thecorrectness of each choice c∈ Cseparately. Since\nthese prompts only include a single choice, LLMs\ncannot use group dynamics. We create two versions\nof this prompt, when the question qis present or ab-\nsent, mirroring the full and choices-only prompts:\nPrompt 5.1: Individual Full Prompt\nQuestion: q\nChoice: c\nAnswer: True {ifc=cgelse}False\nPrompt 5.2: Individual Choices-Only Prompt\nChoice: c\nAnswer: True {ifc=cgelse}False\nOur other few-shot prompts include all choices,\nusing nMCQA questions as exemplars for an n-\nshot prompt, but the above individual prompts must\nbe adapted to manage the increase of 4ntotal exem-\nplars (4 choices cpernquestions). Thus, to keep\nann-shot format, we segment the exemplars such\nthat⌈n\n2⌉classify a random distractor as False and\n⌊n\n2⌋classify the gold answer as True , balancing\nexposure to both True andFalse labels.\n5.2 Converting Individual Scores\nTo study MCQA when LLMs can use individual pri-\nors and group dynamics versus only individual pri-\nors, we seek to compare the accuracies of the group\nfull and choices-only prompts (Prompts 2.1, 3.1)\nagainst their individual counterparts (Prompts 5.1,\n5.2). But the group setting is four-way classifica-\ntion, while the individual setting is binary classifi-\ncation, preventing a direct comparison of the tasks.\nThus, we introduce a function that converts the\nbinary accuracy in the individual setting to a score\ncomparable to the four-way accuracy in the group\nsetting. Based on elimination testing (Ben-Simon\net al., 1997), we define score (Ctrue, cg), returning\nthe chance the LLM picks the gold choice cg∈ C\ngiven the choices Ctrue⊆ C it classifies as True :\nscore (Ctrue, cg) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f30.25 if|Ctrue|= 0\n0 elifcg/∈ C true\n1\n|Ctrue|elifcg∈ C true\nIf the LLM predicts False for all choices (i.e.\n|Ctrue|= 0), it implies uncertainty and equates to\nrandom guessing, giving a score of 0.25. Other-\nwise, if the LLM does not classify the gold answer\ncgasTrue (i.e.cg/∈ C true), the LLM would not\nselect cgwhen given C, resulting in a score of 0.\nLastly, when cg∈ C true, the LLM’s ability to pick', 'Figure 2: LLM accuracy with full prompts versus the partial-input choices-only prompts . An asterisk ( *) denotes\nthat the choices-only prompt significantly outperforms the majority class baseline (two-sample t-test, p < 5e-5).\nFigure 3: LLM accuracy with full prompts versus our three tested memorization prompts\n3.2 Results\nIn 11/12 cases, the choices-only prompt surpasses\nthe majority baseline significantly, indicating that\nLLMs may be using artifacts in MCQA bench-\nmarks (Figure 2). Further, larger LLMs tend to\nhave higher choices-only accuracy, implying that\nmore capable LLMs may use artifacts to a higher\ndegree. In Appendix B.1, we analyze scaling laws\nwith LLaMA to understand this relation more.\nTakeaway: Prior work has found artifacts with\ntrained partial-input models (Gururangan et al.,\n2018), but we are the first to show that LLMs ex-\nhibit high choices-only accuracy in MCQA bench-\nmarks, even in few-shot settings with limited exem-\nplars. For researchers seeking to have LLMs per-\nform MCQA as intended, where both the question\nand choices are needed, we recommend three ap-\nproaches: First, along with typical MCQA metrics,\nchoices-only prompts can be reported as stronger al-\nternatives to majority baselines (Poliak et al., 2018).\nSecond, researchers can design datasets with more\nrobust protocols, such as the Winograd pair format\n(Levesque et al., 2011), to mitigate the potential for\nartifacts. Third, HellaSwag has the highest choices-\nonly accuracy (0.585 with LLaMA) and it is also\nthe only dataset with human -written gold answers\nandmodel -written distractors. Thus, the gold an-\nswers may contain stylistic cues distinct from the\ndistractors, which can inform strong discriminators\nlike LLMs in partial-input settings. To avoid intro-\nducing such artifacts, we advise researchers to use\na consistent approach when generating text data.\n4 Hypothesis 1: Memorization\nOur first hypothesis to explain choices-only accu-\nracy is test set leakage, where the LLM is trainedon the test set (Zhou et al., 2023). If this occurred,\nthe LLM could recall the answer via memoriza-\ntion (Huang et al., 2022). To test this, we design\nprompts only answerable via memorization (§4.1).\nWe assess these prompts and find that memoriza-\ntion cannot explain choices-only accuracy (§4.2).\n4.1 Prompt Design\nWhile it is possible to test memorization via con-\ntamination analysis (Sainz et al., 2023), this does\nnot reveal how memorization affects MCQA accu-\nracy. As a simple solution, we create partial-input\nprompts where the LLM must return the letter aof\nthe correct choice, but without any discriminative\ninformation in the choices. Such prompts are only\nanswerable if the LLM has already been trained on\nthe example, allowing us to quantify how memo-\nrization alone impacts choices-only accuracy:\nPrompt 4.1: Gold Choices Prompt\nQuestion: q\nChoices: \\n(A) cg\\n(B) cg\\n(C) cg\\n(D) cg\nAnswer: a\nPrompt 4.2: Empty Choices Prompt\nQuestion: q\nChoices: \\n(A) \\n(B) \\n(C) \\n(D)\nAnswer: a\nPrompt 4.3: No Choices Prompt\nQuestion: q\nAnswer: a\nWe cannot detect all forms of memorization, as\nadversarial actors could train an LLM on the test\nset while shuffling the choice order, bypassing our\nprompts. However, we assume a non-adversarial\nsetting to test exact memorization and conjecture\nthat if substantial exact memorization had occurred,']","Priors and group dynamics affect LLMs' MCQA accuracy by allowing the models to make decisions based on learned strong priors over specific choices and by evaluating the correctness of a choice based on its relation to surrounding choices.

How does CrowS-Pairs tackle social bias in LLMs given training data biases and diverse task needs?,"['Computational Linguistics\ntribution difference of a LLM in language selection based on different demographic groups. Compared\nto the social bias, unfairness is the external form, which re ﬂected in the output performance of speciﬁc\ntasks, for example, the African American English (AAE) is fr equently mis-classiﬁed as the offensive lan-\nguage by some language detector ( Lwowski et al., 2022 ). However, issues of unfairness and social bias\nare inevitable as they are widely distributed in human langu ages, and LLMs are required to memorize\nlanguage as accurately as possible in the training stage ( Weidinger et al., 2021 ). With respect to evaluate\nthis important aspect, CrowS-Pairs ( Nangia et al., 2020 ) is benchmark proposed to evaluating social bias.\nThere are 1508 examples in CrowS-Pairs that involves nine ty pes of social bias, like gender, race, and\nNationality. StereoSet ( Nadeem et al., 2021 ) is a dataset that could be used to evaluate social bias level\nin both word-level and sentence level, which examples are in four domains: race, gender,religion, and\nprofession. For the StereoSet, the bias level is computed by the difference between model generation\nprobabilities of biased and anti-biased sentence.\n2.4.3 Others\nAs current algorithms for model safety based on the human per ception, there is still no golden standard-\nized judgement for LLMs to refer to, especially when a judgem ent is highly various across societies.\nIt is necessary to align LLMs with the morality, ethics, and v alues of human society. More and more\nworks focus on reifying this abstract concept into textual d ata recently, for example, Sap et al. (2020 ) pro-\nposal an implicit reasoning frame to explain the underlying harm of the target language. Besides, other\nworks leverage rule-of-thumb (RoT) annotations of texts to support the judgement ( Forbes et al., 2020 ;\nZiems et al., 2022 ). However, current works in this area are neonatal, and we co uld expect more related\nworks in the future.\nBesides, we are also concerned about the privacy and politic al risks of LLMs. Since the LLMs are\ntrained on vast corpus collected from books, conversations , web texts and so on, the privacy safety of\nLLMs arouses people’s concern. These training texts might c ontain the private or sensitive information\nsuch as personal physical information, home address, etc. M any studies indicate LLMs are brittle under\nattacks, leaking the sensitive information unintentional ly (Carlini et al., 2020 ;Li et al., 2022 ). Therefore,\nit is essential to test the privacy protection ability of a LL M. Moreover, the politics ignorance is also\nintractable for a LLM. The politics-related risk mainly ste ms from the composition of the training corpus.\nTexts in the corpus are derived from different language and s ocial environments (usually the larger the\nmore diversiﬁed), and different countries have different p olitical prudence and stance, which brings\nadditional risks to the wide deployment of a LM.\n3 Future Directions\nIn this section, we outline some other competencies that are important for evaluating LLMs.\n3.1 Sentiment\nIt is crucial to equip LLMs with the ability to understand and generate sentiments. As an indispensable\nfactor in human life, sentiments are widely present in daily chats, social media posts, customer reviews,\nand news articles ( Liu, 2015 ). Through the comprehensive research and high-level summa ry of the liter-\nature related to sentiments, we introduce the sentiment com petency of LLMs in two aspects: sentiment\nunderstand and sentiment generation.\n3.1.1 Sentiment Understanding\nSentiment understand mainly involves the understanding of opinions, sentiments and emotions in\nthe text ( Liu, 2015 ). Representative tasks that reﬂect this competency includ e sentiment classiﬁ-\ncation (SC), aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), and m ultifaceted analysis of subjective texts\n(MAST). SC aims at assigning pre-deﬁned sentiment classes t o given texts. The typical datasets\ninclude IMDB ( Maas et al., 2011 ), SST ( Socher et al., 2013 ), Twitter ( Rosenthal et al., 2017 ), Yelp\n(Zhang et al., 2015 ). ABSA focuses on identifying the sentiments of speciﬁc asp ects in a sentence\n(Zhang et al., 2022 ), and the most widely used datasets are the SemEval series ( Pontiki et al., 2014 ;\nPontiki et al., 2015 ;Pontiki et al., 2016 ). MAST are tasks that involve the ﬁner-grained and broader', '2 Lu Wang, Max Song, Rezvaneh Rezapour, Bum Chul Kwon, and Jina Huh-Yoo\nHowever, LLMs have been documented to inherit social bias from training data [ 23,97], leading to unjust treatment\nof marginalized communities including the unjust association of Muslims with violence [ 1], as well as an excessive\nrepresentation of gun violence, homelessness, and drug addiction in discussions concerning mental illness [ 37]. While\nresearchers are actively working on developing evaluations [ 74,92,95] to assess the biases in LLMs, some biases are\nbelieved inevitable due to the inherent nature of language and cultural norms [ 23]. The complexity of sociocultural\nfactors complicates the investigation, the integration of diverse tasks within a single model adds to the challenges\nfaced by LLMs, and the disagreements of individual user opinions and preferences contribute to the complexity of the\nissue. Researchers also assert that creating a perfectly safe model requires models to deeply understand languages until\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) itself becomes a reality [90].\nThere are controversial conversations among researchers about the efficacy, ethics, and intellectual abilities of LLMs\n[10,55]. Various research methodologies employ human evaluation to gain a deeper understanding of LLMs and assess\ntheir performance more effectively. Given the extensive range of applications for LLMs, it is crucial to gain insight into\nhow individuals perceive LLMs and what kind of biases they might consider significant. Specifically, we will investigate\nthe following research questions:\n•RQ1: In studies examining people’s perceptions of LLMs, what specific biases did researchers explore?\n•RQ2: In which settings or contexts were LLMs applied in these studies?\n•RQ3: What were the findings regarding people’s perceptions of LLMs as explored in these studies?\nThrough a systematic review, this study informs the different biases of LLMs studied, the existing applications of\nLLMs evaluated from perspectives of human evaluators, dimensions of people’s perceptions of LLM investigated by\nresearchers, and the gaps as well as the opportunities for future research. Developers and designers will benefit from\nthese findings for future development and applications of user-centered LLMs. The insights could also be generalized to\nhuman-centered AI design considering the bias.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Natural Language Processing and LLMs\nSince the introduction of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), the AI space has become increasingly popular\ndue to its capability of successfully “understanding” and generating natural language [ 23,31,97]. Paying homage to the\nearly development of language models, recurrent neural networks, and transformer models, LLMs such as ChatGPT and\nGoogle Bard have shown significant success in various language-related tasks such as translation [ 42], text generation\n[48], summarization[94], question answering [77], and sentiment analysis[23, 31].\nLLMs boast a diverse array of applications across two primary scenarios: creative generation and decision-making\n[97]. In creative generation, LLMs are employed to produce innovative and imaginative content, encompassing tasks\nlike crafting a narrative, composing poetry, or scripting dialogue for a film. For decision-making, LLMs are used to\nmake informed decisions based on natural language instruction, which can be observed in tasks on sentiment analysis,\ntext classification, and question answering [31, 97].\nFurthermore, these LLM applications extend across a variety of different fields, like education (e.g., students are\nengaging with their course material in entirely new ways) [ 16,32,76], finance (e.g., LLMs designed specifically for\nfinance, like BloombergGPT [ 87], have revolutionized financial NLP tasks like risk assessment, algorithmic trading,\nmarket prediction and financial reporting [ 31]), engineering (e.g., especially in software engineering, LLMs assist with\ncode generation, debugging, software testing, documentation generation, and collaboration [ 24,31]), and healthcare\nManuscript submitted to ACM']","CrowS-Pairs is a benchmark proposed to evaluate social bias in LLMs. It includes 1508 examples that involve nine types of social bias, such as gender, race, and nationality.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '9', 'file_name': '2308.07902v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2308.07902v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 280723, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2309.14504v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.14504v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1161532, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

Since\nthe internal reasoning of the LLM can be partially\nobserved through the output explanation, back-\ntranslating such explanations into the source lan-\nguage allows us to compare the internal reasoning\nused to solve the problem in each language. High\nsimilarity of explanations should indicate homo-\ngeneity in using the same internal reasoning pro-\ncess to perform the task in both languages.

Finally, a subordinate model heavily\ndepends on an internal translation process, which\nwe expect to lead to some deterioration of output\nquality across languages.\nTesting on TV tasks provide additional informa-\ntion, which can be used to distinguish between coor-\ndinate and subordinate models.

In contrast, a pure subordinate model is\nexpected to reason only in the dominant language,\nproducing relatively similar results in different lan-\nguages, regardless of whether the correct output is\npreserved after translation.\n5 Experiments\nWe apply the methodology proposed in Section 4\nto TE and TV tasks.

The former\nis subject to the conventions of the specific lan-\nguage and culture, while the latter involves word\npolysemy, which is often sensitive to translation.\nFigure 3 shows an example where a pun is present\nin the original English input, but not in the Span-\nish translation, making the classification dependent\nupon the order in which translation is applied.\n4 Methods\nIn this section, we present our approach to analyz-\ning the multilingual ability of LLMs. Our methods\ninvolve prompt translation (PT) and response back-\ntranslation (RBT). They are designed to measure\nperformance of an LLM, and its consistency across\nlanguages. In our experiments, we apply these\nmethods to both TE and TV tasks, with the aim of\ndetermining the type of bilingualism (compound,\ncoordinate, or subordinate) exhibited by an LLM.\n4.1 Prompt Translation\nMultilingual datasets are unvailable for many tasks.\nHowever, with state-of-the-art machine translation\n(MT) systems and LLMs, we can translate monolin-\ngual datasets for TE tasks to generate parallel mul-\ntilingual parallel data with minimal loss of infor-\nmation (Whitehouse et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023).\nThis is the key intuition behind prompt transla-\ntion (PT); an example is shown in Figure 4a, where\nan English multiple choice question, and its possi-\nble answers, are translated to Chinese. The LLM is\nthen prompted, and the response is given and eval-\nuated, in Chinese. Prompting in distinct languages\nis performed in independent LLM sessions.\nWe measure the differences in multilingual task\nperformance by comparing the answers given by\nthe LLM in each language. Assuming that the LLM\n周二。Translation Equivariant (TE)\nTranslation V ariant (TV)\nYes.No.Tuesday .周一后是周几？\nWhat day is it after Monday?\nUna bicicleta no puede sostenerse por sí\nsola ya que tiene dos llantas.\nA bicycle can’t stand on its own\nsince it’ s two-tired.\nFigure 3: A TE task (common sense reasoning) and a\nTV task (pun detection). Translation is denoted by g,\nandfis the solver function.\nsuccessfully learns to solve a TE task in a language-\nindependent way, the pairwise responses for each\ninstance should be the same after the translation (re-\ngardless of whether it is correct or incorrect). This\nis because TE tasks, such as mathematical problem\nsolving, do not depend on the language used to\nquery the LLMs, as the solution does not depend\non the language used to express the problem.\n4.2 Response Back-Translation\nOne of the goals of our work is to understand what\nthe consistency of LLM output across languages\ntells us about the model, and to determine the type\nof bilingualism an LLM exhibits. This is crucial for\nindividuals who use LLMs for multilingual tasks,\nas it can impact the way task results are gener-\nated, and affect the quality and consistency of the\nresults. For example, a network exhibiting sub-\nordinate bilingualism would produce output that\nappears to be the result of translation, rather than\nresembling text generated by a native speaker of\nthe output language.\nTo quantitatively measure how reasoning is per-\nformed, we propose a prompting method based on\nback-translation, as illustrated in Figure 4b. Simi-\nlar to prompt translation (Section 4.1), we begin by\ntranslating the instance to the target language, and\nprompting the LLM to produce a response in that\nlanguage. After obtaining output from the LLM,\nregardless of the language, we further prompt the\nLLM to generate an explanation for its output (e.g.,\n“Explain how you obtain this result” ); and then trans-\nlate the output of the LLM back to the original\nlanguage. We then compare the explanation given']","Compound LLMs exhibit consistent results on TE tasks across different languages, as their performance does not depend on the language in which a question is presented. Coordinate LLMs access distinct representations in different languages, which may result in different reasoning and answers. Subordinate LLMs heavily depend on an internal translation process, leading to some deterioration of output quality across languages. For TV tasks, coordinate LLMs reason differently for each language, yielding different outputs, while subordinate LLMs reason only in the dominant language, producing relatively similar results across languages.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1291780, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2305.16339v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1291780, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

IntroductionThe origins of the ﬁrst AI language models can be found in the early history of AI.One of the oldest instances of an AI language model is the ELIZA language model, whichmade its debut in 1966 at MIT[1,2].An LLM is a development of the language model ideain AI that signiﬁcantly increases the amount of data utilized for inference and training. Asa result, the AI model’s capabilities are greatly increased. An LLM normally includes atleast one billion parameters, while there isn’t a deﬁned size for the data set that must beused for training.A trained deep-learning model called a big language model can read andproduce text in a way that is similar to what a human would. Everything is accomplishedbehind the scenes using a sizable transformer model. In 2017[3] “Attention is All YouNeed,” to establish a transformer model (The ‘T’ in all the GPT models). It is based on theattention mechanism, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Transformerlanguage models use a deep neural network architecture called a Transformer and they aretrained to predict either masked words (i.e. ﬁll-in-the-blank) or upcoming words in text[4].Uszkoreit et al. describe the Transformer, a cutting-edge neural network design based on aself-attention mechanism that aims to be especially effective at interpreting language[5].Transformer language models have revolutionized the ﬁeld of natural language processing(NLP) since their introduction in 2018[6]. Transformer language models have receivedwidespread public attention, yet their generated text is often surprising even to NLPresearchers[4,7]. As per recent research, some of the top LLMs announced and releasedin the last few years (e.g. GPT-3/4[8], LLaMA[9], PaLM[10], MiniGPT-4[11], FinGPT[12],OPT[13], BERT[14], Bloomberggpt[15], BLOOM 176B[16], GPT NEO-X[17], RoBERTa [18],Dolly2.0[19] ;)[10,13,20–22]. For applications ranging from web search and chatbots to1', 'Large Language Models: A Survey\nShervin Minaee, Tomas Mikolov, Narjes Nikzad, Meysam Chenaghlu\nRichard Socher, Xavier Amatriain, Jianfeng Gao\nAbstract —Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn a\nlot of attention due to their strong performance on a wide\nrange of natural language tasks, since the release of ChatGPT\nin November 2022. LLMs’ ability of general-purpose language\nunderstanding and generation is acquired by training billions of\nmodel’s parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted\nby scaling laws [1], [2]. The research area of LLMs, while very\nrecent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways. In this paper,\nwe review some of the most prominent LLMs, including three\npopular LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss their\ncharacteristics, contributions and limitations. We also give an\noverview of techniques developed to build, and augment LLMs.\nWe then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training,\nfine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluation\nmetrics, and compare the performance of several popular LLMs\non a set of representative benchmarks. Finally, we conclude\nthe paper by discussing open challenges and future research\ndirections.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nLanguage modeling is a long-standing research topic, dat-\ning back to the 1950s with Shannon’s application of informa-\ntion theory to human language, where he measured how well\nsimple n-gram language models predict or compress natural\nlanguage text [3]. Since then, statistical language modeling\nbecame fundamental to many natural language understanding\nand generation tasks, ranging from speech recognition, ma-\nchine translation, to information retrieval [4], [5], [6].\nThe recent advances on transformer-based large language\nmodels (LLMs), pretrained on Web-scale text corpora, signif-\nicantly extended the capabilities of language models (LLMs).\nFor example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4 can be used not\nonly for natural language processing, but also as general task\nsolvers to power Microsoft’s Co-Pilot systems, for instance,\ncan follow human instructions of complex new tasks per-\nforming multi-step reasoning when needed. LLMs are thus\nbecoming the basic building block for the development of\ngeneral-purpose AI agents or artificial general intelligence\n(AGI).\nAs the field of LLMs is moving fast, with new findings,\nmodels and techniques being published in a matter of months\nor weeks [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], AI researchers and practi-\ntioners often find it challenging to figure out the best recipes\nto build LLM-powered AI systems for their tasks. This paper\ngives a timely survey of the recent advances on LLMs. We\nhope this survey will prove a valuable and accessible resource\nfor students, researchers and developers.\nLLMs are large-scale, pre-trained, statistical language mod-\nels based on neural networks. The recent success of LLMs is\nan accumulation of decades of research and development of\nlanguage models, which can be categorized into four wavesthat have different starting points and velocity: statistical lan-\nguage models, neural language models, pre-trained language\nmodels and LLMs.\nStatistical language models (SLMs) view text as a sequence\nof words, and estimate the probability of text as the product\nof their word probabilities. The dominating form of SLMs\nare Markov chain models known as the n-gram models,\nwhich compute the probability of a word conditioned on its\nimmediate proceeding n−1words. Since word probabilities\nare estimated using word and n-gram counts collected from\ntext corpora, the model needs to deal with data sparsity (i.e.,\nassigning zero probabilities to unseen words or n-grams) by\nusing smoothing , where some probability mass of the model\nis reserved for unseen n-grams [12]. N-gram models are\nwidely used in many NLP systems. However, these models\nare incomplete in that they cannot fully capture the diversity\nand variability of natural language due to data sparsity.\nEarly neural language models (NLMs) [13], [14], [15], [16]\ndeal with data sparsity by mapping words to low-dimensional\ncontinuous vectors (embedding vectors) and predict the next\nword based on the aggregation of the embedding vectors of\nits proceeding words using neural networks. The embedding\nvectors learned by NLMs define a hidden space where the\nsemantic similarity between vectors can be readily computed\nas their distance. This opens the door to computing semantic\nsimilarity of any two inputs regardless their forms (e.g., queries\nvs. documents in Web search [17], [18], sentences in different\nlanguages in machine translation [19], [20]) or modalities (e.g.,\nimage and text in image captioning [21], [22]). Early NLMs are\ntask-specific models, in that they are trained on task-specific\ndata and their learned hidden space is task-specific.\nPre-trained language models (PLMs), unlike early NLMs,\nare task-agnostic. This generality also extends to the learned\nhidden embedding space. The training and inference of PLMs\nfollows the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, where lan-\nguage models with recurrent neural networks [23] or trans-\nformers [24], [25], [26] are pre-trained on Web-scale unlabeled\ntext corpora for general tasks such as word prediction, and then\nfinetuned to specific tasks using small amounts of (labeled)\ntask-specific data. Recent surveys on PLMs include [8], [27],\n[28].\nLarge language models (LLMs) mainly refer to\ntransformer-based neural language models1that contain\ntens to hundreds of billions of parameters, which are pre-\ntrained on massive text data, such as PaLM [31], LLaMA\n[32], and GPT-4 [33], as summarized in Table III. Compared\n1Recently, several very promising non-transformer LLMs have been pro-\nposed, such as the LLMs based on structured state space models [29], [30].\nSee Section VII for more details.arXiv:2402.06196v2  [cs.CL]  20 Feb 2024']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '1', 'file_name': '2307.10188v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2307.10188v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 776838, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '1', 'file_name': '2402.06196v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.06196v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4871171, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

More Examples\nWe showcase additional examples of video dialogues across\nvarious tasks, encompassing a creative task (Figure 4), a\nfine-grained understanding task (Figure 5), and a video rea-\nsoning task (Figure 6). In the creative task (Figure 4), our\nVTimeLLM demonstrates a remarkable capacity to compre-\nhend visual information and subsequently craft a poem in-\nspired by it. This achievement is attributed to we freeze\nthe LLM at all three stages of training, thereby preserv-\ning its ability for engaging in creative dialogue.

Conversely,\nthere is an 80% probability of transformation into Multi-\nturn QA. In this scenario, each event is individually queried\nand answered within a dialogue, in the form of two tasks,\nevent captioning or temporal grounding. We provide 10\ntemplates for each task, as shown in Box 3.\nIn Stage 3, we need to transform events into high-quality\ndialogue. This is accomplished by providing a prompt to\na text-based LLM(Vicuna-7B v1.5). The prompt can be\nfound in Box 4. In the prompt, specific timestamps are\nnot provided because their inclusion does not enhance the\nLLM’s comprehension of temporal relationships. On the\ncontrary, they may introduce errors into the dialogue.

We further analyze the\nstatistics information of our benchmark.\n2.1 Benchmark Overview\nBenchmark components Our benchmark focuses\non two basic tasks within PowerPoint: creating the\nnew PPT file and editing the existing long PPT\ntemplate for measuring long PPT Content under-\nstanding. We have gathered 229 multi-turn dia-\nlogue sessions for creating the new PPT file and\n50 sessions for editing existing templates. Each\nmulti-turn session includes 2 to 17 turns. Each turn\ncomprises three parts: (1) the user instruction (2)\nthe label output file as the ground truth (3) one feasi-\nble API sequence for finishing the instruction. Our\nbenchmark also contains an API reference file that\nincludes 49 feasible APIs for various operations\nand can complete all instructions in our benchmark.\nFor each API, we describe its functionality and\narguments and provide usage guidelines. For com-\nplex APIs, we also offer example cases. We list the\ndetails of all APIs in Appendix A.\nTask description To complete the instruction in\none turn, in general, the AI assistant must compre-\nhend the user’s current and prior instructions for\ncontext. It should also analyze the content of the\nPPT file to identify relevant objects mentioned in\nthe instruction. Additionally, it needs to select ap-\npropriate APIs from a reference API file to achieve\nthe user’s goals. So we use these as the input of the\nAI assistant and it should output an API sequence\nas the solution. Then, it executes this API sequence\nand provides the user with the resulting PPT file as\nits response (See the whole process in Figure 2).\nAddressing LLM limitations in our bench-\nmark Compared to the general AI assistant, LLMs\nstill have two limitations for completing the task\nin our benchmarks: (1) LLMs can not directly pro-\ncess the PPT file. So we provide a PPT reader\nfunction that extracts all shapes and their informa-\ntion from the PPT file and transforms them into the\ntext format as the PPT file content. Then LLMs can\nunderstand and process the PPT file content. (2)\nLLMs cannot directly use PPT software through a\nkeyboard and mouse. Therefore, we have defined\nPPT APIs based on the operational logic within\nthe PPT software. and provide an implementation\nfor these APIs in Python that can swiftly gener-\nate PPT files.

Also, their evaluation\napproach focuses on comparing the generated APIs\nwith the label API sequence, assuming there’s only\none unique solution. This approach becomes im-\npracticable in situations with multiple/unlimited\ncorrect solutions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Power- PointTaskCompletion (PPTC),\na benchmark that measures LLMs’ performance in\ncreating and editing PPT file tasks based on user\ninstructions. We choose PowerPoint as it includes\nvarious elements like textbox, table, and image and\nsupports a wider range of APIs than Word and Ex-\ncel.\nOur benchmark has three distinctive featuresarXiv:2311.01767v2  [cs.CL]  7 Nov 2023']","GPT-4 achieves 75.1% accuracy in single-turn dialogue testing but faces challenges in completing entire sessions, achieving just 6% session accuracy.

How do follow-ups and wait times differ in med self-diagnosis vs. creative planning with LLM voice assistants?,"['LLM-Powered Conversational Voice Assistants 13\n(2) (1)\nInitiationH\nn=60\nIntroductionVA\n(4) (3)\n(5)\nEnd-intentH\nn=60\nClosingVA\nQuestion:\nfactualH\nAnswer:\nfactualVA\nQuestionH\nStatementH\nor\nStatement:\negocentricVA\nAnswer:\negocentricVA\nor\nUser\nqueryH\nn=737\nn=52\nt>6s\nt=0st>2s\nVA\nResponseVA\nFillerVA\nby design\n Question:\nsmall talkVA\nby design\nAnswer:\nopinionH\nVA\nResponseVA\nAcknowledgeVA\nby designfollow-up\nquestion\nFig. 5. Common interaction patterns observed across all tasks, including how the user starts the conversation (1) and concludes it (2);\ncommon patterns consistent throughout the scenarios for question–answer pairs (3) and (4); and wait patterns emerging from our\ndesign including filler andsmall talk questions. Green indicates user actions (states), while orange denotes VA actions. Arrows signify\ntransitions between states. “User query” encompasses various user speech acts like questions or statements. “By design” refers to VA\nstates emerging from our implementation, such as fillers. “n” indicates the number of times a pattern occurs.\nis almost always followed by a factual answer by the VA, Fig. 5(3). Within the conversation, most factual question-factual\nanswer pairs are followed by follow-up questions. A question is characterized as a follow-up if it emerges as a result of\nthe VA’s prior response, requires conversation history for context (context-conscious), or has words or phrases that\nindicate the intention to continue the prior conversation, such as “and,” “also,” or “okay, so.” ChatGPT’s capability of\nutilizing conversation history to understand context enables an interaction’s progression with rather vague follow-up\nquestions. see Table. 4 C3 for an example of such an interaction pattern. The question-answer pattern varies across\ntasks, apart from the question: factual→answer: factual pair.\n4.1.4 Perspective of speech: Question/Statement →Answer/Statement: egocentric. We observe the VA’s response is\nmostly egocentric (you-perspective) irrespective of whether the participant communicates in an egocentric orexocentric\nmanner. Fig. 5(4). C4 and C5 in Table 4 reflect this interaction pattern.\n4.1.5 Wait. Wait patterns in user interactions with VAs are a byproduct of features designed to handle potential system\ndelays, such as those encountered during information retrieval. For delays under 2 seconds, the interaction remains\nuninterrupted; however, when a response from the ChatGPT API exceeds the 2-second mark, two distinct patterns\nemerge (see C6 in Table 4 as an example):\n•Short wait pattern. If information retrieval takes more than 2 seconds, the VA delivers filler statements such as\n“I’m looking it up.” In our interaction data, there are 737 ( 76.06%of total turns) short wait patterns, Fig. 5(5).\nManuscript submitted to ACM', 'LLM-Powered Conversational Voice Assistants 15\nfood?” After the participant responds, the assistant acknowledges with comments such as “Interesting” or\n“Thanks for sharing” before transitioning back to deliver the originally requested information. There are 52\n(5.37%of interaction turns) instances of a long wait pattern in the interaction data; see Fig. 5(5). We note that\nall small talk questions were answered by participants; in fact, participants sometimes answered the question\nintended as small talk by fully engaging with it. For instance, one participant stays in character (i.e., pretending\nto be sick) when asked about their typical day: “Right now, it’s not much because I’m too sick to do anything\nand I could really use this help with the name of the cough [syrup] brands.”\nBelow, we explore interaction patterns specific to each scenario; we address patterns that arise both at the onset of\nthe task and as each scenario progresses. Conversations ended with the end-intent→closing pattern for all three tasks.\n4.2 Medical Self-Diagnosis Interaction Patterns\nThe medical self-diagnois task was usually initiated by a participant’s cough being recognized as intent. As the task\nprogressed, we identified two recurring patterns; both patterns emerge from question-answer pairs, see Fig. 6.\n4.2.1 Question: generic →Answer: factual + statement: warning. In our medical information-seeking scenario, most\nquestions that were formulated as generic (𝑁=144) were handled by the VA with a factual response, see Fig. 6(1). The\nVA’s response was also generally followed by a warning statement such as “However, it’s important to consult a doctor\nor pharmacist ...” See C7 in Table 5 for an example of the question: generic→answer: factual + statement: warning\ninteraction pattern. We also observed that participants asked follow-up questions throughout the scenario.\n4.2.2 Question: specific →Answer: refusal + statement: warning. In our medical self-diagnosis scenario, when partic-\nipants sought the VA’s advice on topics such as specific medication choices or the best medicines available, the VA\ndid not provide a direct answer and instead offered a warning (𝑁=15) (see Fig. 6(2)). Faced with this, participants\neither pressed the VA by rewording or repeating their question ( 𝑁=6) or proceeded to a different query ( 𝑁=9). For\nexample, in conversation C8 (Table 5), the participant rephrases their question two times in an attempt to obtain specific\nbrand recommendations for cough medicines containing expectorants. Eventually, the VA offers a factual response that\nmentions some brand names, but also includes a cautionary warning urging the user to consult an expert.\n4.3 Creative Planning Interaction Patterns\nThe trip planning scenario usually started with participants’ intent to start the conversation (initiation) as shown in Fig.\n5(1). We identified two patterns specific to the creative planning scenario; both patterns emerge from question-answer\npairs (see Fig. 7) during the progression of task. We note that participants asked follow-up questions in both patterns.\n4.3.1 Question: generic →Answer: factual, descriptive. During planning their day, when the participants posed broad,\ngeneral questions to the VA—such as asking recommendations of sights to see or places to dine—or when they sought\nthe VA’s personal opinion on such topics, the VA responded in a descriptive style (𝑁=123, see Fig. 7(1). The objectivity\nof a question (factual oropinion) did not affect the VA’s response. See C9 and C10 (Table 6) for examples of this pattern.\n4.3.2 Question: specific →Answer: factual, directive. In the creative planning scenario, when participants mapped out\ntheir day and posed specific queries—such as asking directions to a place or about its operating hours—the VA replied\nin adirective style of communication ( 𝑁=97), see Fig. 7(2). For example, in conversation C11 (Table 6), the participant\nsought directions from point A to point B and the VA simply provided those directions.\nManuscript submitted to ACM']","In the medical self-diagnosis scenario, follow-up questions often arise from the VA's factual responses, and the VA frequently includes a warning statement. Wait times in this scenario involve short waits with filler statements and long waits with acknowledgments before delivering the requested information. In the creative planning scenario, follow-up questions also occur, but the VA's responses are more descriptive for generic questions and directive for specific questions. Wait times are not explicitly detailed for this scenario.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '13', 'file_name': '2309.13879v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.13879v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4407099, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '15', 'file_name': '2309.13879v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.13879v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4407099, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

The main com-\nponent of the input is composed of three components:\nTask Description (I): By explicitly providing instruc-\ntions, we delineate the use of the model for recommendation\nsystems.\nUser Historical Behavior Description (H): This repre-\nsents the comprehensive historical interactions between theuser and the item in a natural language format.\nH=Encoder h(h1, h2, . . . , h i), (1)\nwhere hirepresents one piece of history record.\nCandidate Items (C): This represents the whole set of\ncandidate items to be ranked.\nC=Encoder c(c1, c2, . . . , c j), (2)\nwhere cjrepresents a candidate item in a natural language\nformat, such as the title of the item.\nThen we obtain the output:\nOutput =LLM (I, H, C ). (3)\nUpon analyzing the results, we discern the recommendation\nranking results of the large model:\nY=y1, y2, . . . , y j=Decoder (Output ). (4)\nThe output items then undergo a basic legality check, and\ninvalid answers are excluded.\nSpecifically, the conversion of the original candidate set\ninto natural language introduces sequential information, af-\nfecting the recommendation results of the system. The se-\nquence of items to be ranked introduces diversity into C.\nConsidering all the permutations, there are j!ways to ar-\nrange the sequence {c1, c2, . . . , c j}. Formally, it can be rep-\nresented as follows:\nC∈[C1, . . . , C k], (5)\nwhere k=j!. Correspondingly,\nY∈[Y1, . . . , Y k], (6)\nwhere k=j!. Given the evaluation metrics, we obtain a per-\nformance score Sifor each ranked output Yi. We calculate\nthe mean value and the variance of Si, which represent the\ncapability and stability of the system, respectively.\nPosition Bias\nIn this section, we explore the characteristics of ChatGPT\n(GPT-3.5-turbo) when using it as a recommender system.\nThe investigation primarily focuses on the sensitivity and\npatterns of the model in four aspects: the prompt template,\ncandidate size, attention to context, and permutation.\nPrompt Template. For the prompt template, we test var-\nious variations, such as removing candidate labels (e.g.\nA/B/C) or replacing candidate labels in Table 1 with Arabic\nnumerals, lowercase letters, Greek characters, Roman nu-\nmerals, or plain lists (e.g. Candidate 1/Candidate 2). As il-\nlustrated in Fig.3, different prompt templates lead to distinct\ntrends in the accuracy of the model’s output. However, all\nof them reveal the issue of position bias, where the model’s\nrecommendation ability is influenced by the different input\nsequences for the candidate items.\nPermutation. Figure 4 shows the situation with four can-\ndidate items. The x-axis represents the position of the\nground truth in the candidate items, and the y-axis represents\nthe permutation situation of the negative samples. There are\nthree negative samples, corresponding to six permutations.']","Prompt templates and item permutations affect LLM-based recommendation systems by introducing position bias. Different prompt templates lead to distinct trends in the accuracy of the model’s output, revealing that the model’s recommendation ability is influenced by the different input sequences for the candidate items.

How does GatorTron-345M perform in identifying overlapped/nested concepts with soft prompts vs. traditional pre-training/fine-tuning?,"['performance of both tasks improves, indicating that larger LLMs have better transfer learning ability for cross-institution applications.  One potential reason is that prompting with unfrozen LLMs will potentially overfit the pretrained model to the training data of a specific institution, whereas prompting with frozen LLMs could keep the generalizability of LLMs to better support cross-institution applications. Our study also demonstrates that soft prompting with frozen LLMs has better few-shot learning performance outperforming traditional pre-training/finetuning and prompting with unfrozen LLMs when the LLMs have over billions of parameters.  Our results show that the few-shot learning and the transfer learning are associated with the size of the model as larger LLMs have more parameters to better deal with unseen samples.  We conducted an error analysis to compare soft prompting with hard prompting and pretraining/fine-tuning and discovered that soft prompting performs better for overlapped or nested concepts and their relations.  For example, the soft prompting using unfrozen GatorTron-345M identified 39% and 82% of the overlapped/nested concepts, outperforming the corresponding GatorTron-345M model trained using traditional pre-training/fine-tuning, which only accurately identified 28% and 9%, respectively.  We also examined how the length of the soft prompts affect the performance. Figure 5 compares the performance of GatorTron-3.9B model using soft prompts with different lengths (8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) using the 2022 n2c2 SDoH dataset. We can see that soft prompting is sensitive to the length of prompts, which could cause performance differences ranging from 1% to 2%.  Overall, moderate-length prompts (i.e., 32 and 64) achieved better F1 scores compared with extremely short or long prompts. In addition, the length of the soft prompts has a more remarkable impact when prompting with frozen LLMs as only the parameters from prompts were updated.

This suggests that when creating models for legal tasks, stacking RLHF on top of SFT can be\ncounterproductive.\nLegal specific fine-tuning is helpful. To assess the impact of legal specific fine-tuning, we contrast\nthree LLMs fine-tuned for legal tasks with their corresponding base models, as depicted in Figure 7.\nIt is evident that after legal specific fine-tuning, there is a consistent enhancement of model scores and\nreduction of abstention rates. This underscores the efficacy of the training strategies employed. Closer\ninspection of the three cognitive levels reveals that Baichuan-7B and LLaMA-13B perform very\npoorly on memorizing tasks, which suggests they have not been pre-trained on large, high-quality legal\ncorpora. Nonetheless, fine-tuning them on legal corpora both lead to significant improvement. Even\nfor LLMs like Ziya-LLama-13b who have excellent memorization of legal principles, fine-tuning that\nis unique to the field of law can significantly boost performance on tests requiring comprehension and\napplying skills. Comparing to the LawGPT series, we found that version 1.1, which is fine-tuned only\non 350k instruction data, outperformed version 1.0 which is fine-tuned on 500k judgement documents\nfollowed by 300k instructions. This suggests that beginning with a lower-performing model and\nundertaking continuous pre-training, which is both time-consuming and resource-intensive, is inferior\nto starting with a superior foundation model and fine-tuning on high-quality instruction data. Future\nresearch may want to try fine-tuning a stronger base model (like qwen-chat or InternLM-chat) for\nbetter performance on legal tasks.\n5 Conclusion\nUsing LLMs to benefit the legal domain is a promising topic. However, existing benchmarks\nto measure the legal knowledge of LLMs either focus on a limited subset of tasks, or are based\non American laws in English language. This paper presents LawBench : a meticulously crafted,\ncomprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess LLMs in performing legal-related tasks under the\nChinese civil law system.

The results demonstrate that current LLMs are still unable to give\nmeaningful judicial aid, and their scores on most tasks are often poor. While fine-tuning open-source\nLLMs on legal specific language results in some advances, they still lag far below GPT-4. As the\nlegal field is highly professional, much of the data used in practical applications is confidential.\nDeveloping a high-quality large language model for legal tasks necessitates collaboration among\nmultiple institutions. We hope the release of LawBench can serve as a foundation for future research\nand we seek to encourage cooperation in order to further this effort.\nLimitations\nThe majority of our datasets are acquired through sampling publicly available data on the internet.\nEven though we have made efforts to select newest versions of datasets, there can still be risks of\ntest data leakage given that existing LLMs have been exhaustively trained on massive amount of\nInternet data. It is possible that LLMs explicitly trained on these task formats, or even the exact test\ndata, can exhibit exceptionally high scores [ 48]. We will seek more principled ways to prevent data\ncontamination in the future.\nAnother notable limitation is the answer extraction methods and evaluation metrics for generative\ntasks. Even though we have hand-engineered task-specific rules to extract the answer, there still\ncan be cases that the rule fails to match. For generative tasks, we only use Rouge-L to evaluate the\nmodel predictions for convenience, which cannot fully reflect the human judgement about the answer\nquality. Currently, there is a lack of automated methods to effectively evaluate model predictions\nfrom legal aspects. We plan to consider training an evaluation model tailored for legal tasks in the\nfuture, or experiment with LLM-based evaluations [39; 73].\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is an extension which was supported by National Key R&D Program of China\n(2016YFC0800803).

Meanwhile,StarCoderPlus, which is a fine-tuned version of StarCoder\ntrained on natural language, showed a substantially worse\nperformance, indicating that training on natural language\ncan hurt performance on code-related tasks. This can also be\nseen in the Bloom family of models: the fine-tuned BloomZ\nmodel performed substantially worse on reproduction than\nthe original Bloom model. Overall, we find that the open-\nsource LLMs can also reproduce a substantial number of\nbugs (albeit lower than the OpenAI models), and thus are\na viable option when security is a greater concern than\nperformance.

How did AutoPrognosis 2.0 and LLMs improve the CVD risk model with UK Biobank data?,"['Redefining Digital Health Interfaces with LLMs 13\nFor example, LLMs could help to alleviate the data burden that is contribut-\ning to clinician burnout, as well as streamline patient management processes.\nFurthermore, studies have demonstrated high usability of LLMs, even with lim-\nited experience [55], which is critical for successful clinical deployment. While\nwe believe this paper represents an important first step, we are only scratch-\ning the surface of the potential of LLMs in healthcare. Ultimately, this line\nof work may significantly change the digital health landscape, enhancing the\ncapabilities of clinicians and the quality of patient care.\nMethods\nData source and study population\nWe developed and validated our prognostic model using data from UK Biobank\n[39], a large prospective cohort of individuals from the UK. Participants in UK\nBiobank were enrolled between 2006 and 2010 and aged between 40 and 70 at\nthe time of recruitment. We extracted a cohort of individuals with no known\nhistory of CVD at baseline. We excluded individuals who had been diagnosed\nwith chronic kidney disease or type 1 diabetes and individuals who were being\ntreated with statins. This resulted in a cohort of 407,605 individuals (Fig. S.2).\nClinical Predictors and Outcomes\nWe began by considering a number of predictors previously validated as CVD\nrisk factors. A subset of features were selected based on their predictive\npower and feature importance. We included 20 features in our model, namely\nsex, age, atrial fibrillation, steroid treatment, type 2 diabetes, hypertension\ntreatment, family history of CVD, systolic blood pressure, smoking status\n(never-smoker, ex-smoker, light smoker, moderate smoker, heavy smoker, alka-\nline phosphatase, apolipoprotein a, apolipoprotein b, cystatin c, C-reactive\nprotein, HbA1c, IGF-1, lipoprotein a, triglycerides, urea, and overall health\nrating, which was self-reported by participants as excellent, good, fair or poor.\nThe primary outcome was incidence of CVD within a 10-year horizon. This\nwas defined using the following ICD-10 codes: myocardial infarction (I21, I22),\nstroke (I63, I64), angina pectoris (I20), or transient cerebral ischaemic attacks\n(G45). There were 17,600 CVD events within a 10-year horizon in the UK\nBiobank cohort.\nModel Derivation\nWe trained a prognostic model using AutoPrognosis 2.0, an open-source\nautomated machine learning software package [19]. AutoPrognosis has been\nvalidated in several applications in medicine, for example to determine eli-\ngibility for lung cancer screening [56].

How do DMP task correction and YOLO perception improve hierarchical tasks in LLM human-robot collaboration?,"['Fig. 2. Experiment data.\nOn the other hand, the first-layer tasks can be sepa-\nrated into multiple short-horizon tasks through LLM. Sub-\nsequently, we process each short-horizon task following its\nspecific procedure to divide them into motion functions\nas mentioned. Finally, motion functions are organized by\nfollowing a planned task sequence to construct the complete\nlong-horizon task. This hierarchical task handling allows\nfor a more organized and effective execution of both short\nand long-horizon tasks, contributing to our system’s overall\nefficiency and accuracy.\n2.2 DMP-based task correction\nTo enhance the generalizability of LLM-based autonomy,\nWe propose to integrate DMP-based task correction with\nhuman teleoperation-driven demonstrations. Dynamic Move-\nment Primitives (DMP) is a generic approach for trajectory\nmodeling in an attractor landscape based on differential dy-\nnamical systems [3]. In this paper, we leverage our previously\ndeveloped teleoperation system[4], [5] which can intuitively\ncontrol the robot motion through a VR device, and also\nutilize DMP to record trajectories obtained from manual\nteleoperation. These trajectories can then be reproduced to\ncomplement any deficiencies in the LLM-based autonomy,\nparticularly in failed function sequence generation or func-\ntion sequence impracticality.\nFor instance, when we issue the command ”catch the\nbowl,” the default motion function for bowl grasping could\nbe inadequate to complete the task. To address this issue, we\nswitch to the DMP-based teleoperation mode and provide\ninstructions for the desired action. The robot can then ac-\ncurately reproduce the trajectory using DMP. This approach\nwill be continually developed to manage a wider range of\nlong-horizon tasks, with the ultimate goal of creating an\neffective Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) system. This\nsystem will strategically take advantage of both human flex-\nibility, in terms of adaptability and problem-solving skills,\nand robot autonomy, in terms of precision and efficiency.\n3. Experiment and Result\nWe conducted multiple experiments by providing ”catch”,\n”put”, ”open” and long-horizon tasks-”clean the top of the\ncabinet” for several objects to assess their success rates (SR),executability (Exec), and feasibility (FSB). The indicator\nNum means the number of trials, and Fns shows the motion\nfunctions used in completing the task. Additionally, Exec\nis defined as if the task is executable in the environment,\nand FSB represents if the motion is feasible to reach the\ngoal. The experimental results are presented in Fig. 2. In\nthe case of the indicator ”Exec” showing 0.80 in the ”clean\nthe top of the cabinet” task, the reasonable explanation is\nthe randomness of LLM, which has a low probability of\ngenerating incorrect responses ( Exec=0.2). As for the FBS\nof 0.00 in the ”catch the bowl” task, this outcome can be\nattributed to the task being impossible to complete due to\nthe default motion function being unsuitable for the target\nobject’s shape. In such cases, the DMP-based task correction\nis used to make necessary demonstrations.\n4. Conclusion\nIn this work, we have successfully proposed a LLM-based\ntask-planning method. An interface is built to integrate the\nLLM, perception pipeline, teleoperation system, and DMP-\nbased task correction. The results show that the robot can\nexecute the command from the user with a considerable\nsuccess rate for short-horizon tasks like ”catch”, ”put”, or\n”open”. Especially, for the task with 0.00 FBS, such as ”catch\nthe bowl”, DMP-based correction is introduced to improve\nit. However, for long-horizon tasks, it shows a relatively low\nsuccess rate. The reason could be the error accumulating with\nmotion. The future work includes the improvement of DMP-\nbased task correction and fine-tuning teleoperation which can\ncomplement the error from hardware to improve the success\nrate and feasibility.\n5.

Introduction\nAs robotics technology advances, the potential for robots\nto assist with domestic chores becomes increasingly promis-\ning. With the ability to understand and process natural\nlanguage, these robots become more adaptable and flexible to\naccommodate a wide range of user instructions[1]. However,\nthe previous works with LLM-based control sometimes show\na relatively low accuracy for high intelligence task decision-\nmaking[1]. Our work introduces the idea of ”LLM-Based\ntask planning with human-robot collaboration”, which is\na novel approach to enhance human supervision in LLM-\nbased autonomy. The contributions of this paper are summa-\nrized as follows: (1) Our LLM converts high-level language\ncommands into sequences of executable motion functions,\nenabling adaptability to various user instructions. (2) Ad-\nditionally, teleoperation and DMP are utilized for motion\ndemonstration which allows the robot to learn from human\nguidance and potentially improves task feasibility and gen-\neralizability. (3) Furthermore, the robot is empowered with\nenvironmental perception through YOLO-based perception\nmodule for targeted tasks. The position of objects will be\nregistered once recognized and update with the real-time\nposition. Combining these elements, the proposed approach\nopens new possibilities for seamless human-robot collabora-\ntion in household tasks, making robots more practical and\nadaptable.\n∗Corresponding author email: zhu@robo.mein.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nThis work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.\nCopyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may\nno longer be accessible\nFig. 1.

Subsequently, we integrate the perceived target\nposition information and motion functions obtained from\nLLM into a prepared code template, enabling the robot to\nexecute the corresponding tasks effectively.

In such cases, these tasks are\nseparated into multiple short-horizon tasks through LLM.\nHowever, short-horizon tasks which involve less than 10\nmotion functions, are treated as the second layer task. When\nLLM receives commands from these second-layer tasks, it\ndirectly returns the functions necessary to accomplish the\ndesignated tasks.arXiv:2308.14972v1  [cs.RO]  29 Aug 2023']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2308.14972v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2308.14972v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 550745, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '1', 'file_name': '2308.14972v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2308.14972v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 550745, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

How do request-response patterns in BurstGPT affect cost optimization techniques?,"['vices. API services exhibit more rapid changes compared\nto conversation services.\n•Unique Spatial and Traffic Patterns in LLM Serving. The\nrequest and response lengths in LLM serving present\ndistinct spatial patterns, characterized by longer runtime\nor response lengths during generative inference. This is\nreflected in the variability of response length distributions,\nand the elevated system throughput when the response\nlengths are collectively long.\n•High Failure Rates in LLM Serving. We observe a\nrelatively high failure rate in LLM serving, primarily\nattributed to the substantial GPU resource occupation.\nIncreased burstiness leads to memory bottlenecks, causing\nspikes in failure rates and performance degradation.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II\nprovides an overview of LLM serving, including foundational\nconcepts, challenges, and the motivation for our trace-based\nanalysis. Then, Section III details the temporal and spatial\nworkload characteristics of BurstGPT observed in our trace data,\nfocusing on the periodic and aperiodic patterns of burstiness\nobserved over varying timeframes, including minutes, hours,\nand days. Additionally, this section presents insights into the\nreliability of GPT services as gleaned from our data. After\nthat, Section IV outlines the benchmark suite we provide\nwith BurstGPT. This includes a detailed description of how to\nutilize the models observed in Section III, the workflow of the\nsuite, and how it works with existing LLM serving frameworks.\nFinally, Section V presents our case study evaluation’s results\nand detailed analysis. Then Section VI provides comprehensive\ndiscussions of these findings.\nII. B ACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION\nThe year 2023 has been a milestone for LLM advancements.\nHundreds of LLMs have been pre-trained and fine-tuned for\ndeployment [ 10][11]. However, there have been few actual\ndeployments up to now. This implies that most LLM providers\nhave yet to fully comprehend the real-world workloads their\nservices will encounter upon deployment. Consequently, opti-\nmizing their LLM serving frameworks to manage real-world\nworkload effectively has emerged as a critical and challenging\ntask [ 12][13]. This includes but is not limited to a detailed\nevaluation of LLM serving systems and real-time workload\nprovisioning based on historical real-world LLM serving traces.\nSuch optimizations are essential for ensuring the efficiency and\nreliability of LLMs in real-time applications.\nTable I.

Preliminary of LLM serving\n1) LLM Architecture: In the construction of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), the fundamental building blocks are trans-\nformer layers [ 5][14], built on self-attention and fully connected\nsub-layers. Fully connected layers are expensive in computa-\ntional Floating-point-operations (FLOPs), while self-attention\nis distinguished by its significant memory consumption [15].\n2) Auto-regressive Decoding: While Deep Neural Net-\nwork (DNN) inferences are typically deterministic and pre-\ndictable [ 16], LLM inference is intrinsically autoregressive\nwithout accurate runtime. This nature of LLM inference\npresents unique considerations for system designs.\nThe inference mechanism of LLM architectures includes\ntwo phases [ 8][5]. During the prefilling phase, the model will\nreceive the prompt and generate the key-value (KV) cache [ 8]\nacross each transformer layer and a new token, which are then\nprovided as input and reused caches to the decoding phase\nfor auto-regressive processing. During decoding, the model\nemploys and updates the KV cache to produce output tokens.\nIn this phase, the LLM processes a sequence of input tokens,\nforming a probabilistic distribution over all possible tokens.\nThe following token is then selected from this distribution and\nappended to the input sequence, becoming the input for the\nnext iteration. This process is repeated until a predetermined\nresponse length is reached or a specific stopping condition is\nmet, such as generating an end-of-sequence ( |<EOS>| ) token.\nThe inherent uncertainty in the steps of the decoding process\nis a notable characteristic.\n3) Optimizations: To reduce the deployment and opera-\ntional expenses of LLM serving, several specialized frame-\nworks have been developed, including TensorRT-LLM [ 17],\nvLLM [ 18], DeepSpeed [ 19], and lightLLM [ 20]. Apart\nfrom these frameworks, various memory and compute\noptimization techniques are invented for efficient decod-\ning [ 21][15][22][23][24][25][26][27], which significantly im-\nprove LLMs’ inference performance in deployments. Also,\nefficient scheduling in LLM inference is crucial for optimizing\nthe service. ORCA [ 28] introduces iteration-level scheduling,\ni.e.,continuous batching , that dynamically adjusts batch size\nduring iterations, allowing immediate replacement of completed\nsequences within a batch, thus improving GPU utilization\nand reducing idle time. Many LLM serving frameworks have\nadopted this method.\nB. Motivation: Evaluating Performance and Reliability of LLM\nServing under Real-world Workloads\n1) Reliability-aware Serving Metrics: In serving systems,\nmany metrics have been suggested for performance evaluation.\nQuality of Service ( QoS) or Service Level Agreement ( SLA),\nand throughput [12] are the main metrics to measure the\nperformance of an LLM service.\na) Latency and Throughput: Sometimes, the communica-\ntion latency between the client and the server is tiny [ 29];\nthus, QoS and SLA are primarily assessed based on the\ncomputational latency of requests. From a QoS perspective, re-\nduced latency indicates enhanced system responsiveness, which\n2', 'Towards Efficient and Reliable LLM Serving:\nA Real-World Workload Study\nYuxin Wang†*, Yuhan Chen‡*, Zeyu Li‡, Zhenheng Tang†, Rui Guo§, Xin Wang§,\nQiang Wang¶, Amelie Chi Zhou†, Xiaowen Chu‡**\n†Dept.

Computer Science, HIT(SZ)\nAbstract —Large language models (LLMs), especially Genera-\ntive Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, have significantly\nadvanced in the industry in recent years. However, these\nmodels’ broader development faces considerable challenges due\nto high operational and deployment costs. This has led to active\nresearch in improving the hardware efficiency of LLMs. Yet, the\ncharacteristics of real-world LLM workloads are often overlooked\nin current optimizations of LLM serving systems. In this work,\nwe find that the absence of reliable workload data for evaluating\nLLM serving systems impacts the quality of service (QoS) and\nreliability in industrial deployments.\nThis paper introduces the first real-world trace dataset of LLM\nserving workloads, detailing user, system, and LLM behaviors. We\nanalyze this trace, highlighting burstiness, request and response\ndistributions, and focusing on the reliability of GPT services. Based\non this, we have developed a benchmark suite that reflects our\ndataset’s workload patterns, enabling performance evaluation of\nserving systems. This suite captures the core patterns of workload\ndistributions, allowing for precise scaling of the workload dataset\nto match system sizes. Our evaluation uncovers a previously\nunrecognized vulnerability of LLM serving systems to short-\nterm burstiness, particularly in common workload scenarios. We\nobserve that GPU memory limitations, caused by the fluctuating\nnature of burstiness, lead to significant performance degradation\nin existing LLM serving systems. Beyond benchmarking, under-\nstanding these patterns is valuable for optimizing LLM workload\nmanagement, enabling elastic hardware resource adjustments\nto varying workloads.

I NTRODUCTION\nRecent years marked a new era for generative AI applications\nwith the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT services [ 1][2]. The advent of ChatGPT\nnot only revolutionized user interactions but also catalyzed the\ndevelopment of other LLMs, such as Google’s Bard [ 3] and\nMeta’s Llama [ 4]. However, despite their potential, deploying\nand operating LLM services is costly. LLMs’ substantial\ncomputational and storage requirements necessitate significant\nAI accelerator resources [ 5], presenting a major challenge for\nsmaller organizations aiming to offer such services.\n*Equal Contribution.**Corresponding author. Email: xwchu@ust.hkTo address the costs associated with LLM serving, existing\nserving systems primarily focus on optimizing system through-\nput and achieving service-level objectives (SLOs). However,\nmore comprehensive evaluations of these systems are limited\nby the absence of real-world workloads. Consequently, these\nstudies often resort to using non-LLM serving workloads in\nexperiments, derived either from synthetic models or other open-\nsource services, e.g., Microsoft Azure Functions (MAF) [ 6][7]\nfor lightweight applications. While these non-LLM traces\nprovide some insights into the bursty workloads, they fail\nto accurately reflect the unique characteristics of real-world\nLLM serving.\nIn addressing this gap, we introduce the first dataset of\nreal-world LLM serving workloads, named BurstGPT. This\ndataset provides insights into the characteristics of LLM\nserving workloads. BurstGPT is gathered over two months\nwithin a campus. It contains 1,429.7 thousand pairs of request-\nresponse lengths from both ChatGPT and GPT-4 models,\nutilized in conversation and API services. Each pair of request-\nresponse lengths includes the associated timestamps of request\nsubmissions . Importantly, to ensure user privacy, the content of\nrequests and responses is not recorded. Additionally, this dataset\nincludes frequent unsuccessful requests , offering insights into\nthe reliability of LLM serving.\nTo leverage BurstGPT for LLM evaluation, particularly to\ninvestigate the reliability of LLM serving, we developed a\nbenchmark suite based on a mirrored version of BurstGPT.\nThis suite models BurstGPT and scales it to fit any system size,\nfitting real-world prompts to the request length distributions\nfor actual serving. It aids in the assessment of the performance\nand reliability of serving systems. We utilized this benchmark\nsuite to evaluate vLLM [ 8], a state-of-the-art LLM serving\nsystem, as a case study in this work. Our key findings in the\nanalysis of BurstGPT, as well as the evaluation of vLLM on\nBurstGPT, are listed below:\n•Burstiniess in Temporal Patterns of LLM Workloads.\n❶We identify unique periodical and aperiodical patterns\nin the bursty concurrency of LLM workloads, varying\nby service and model types.

How do GNNs vs. LLMs differ for molecule prediction on ogbg-molfreesolv and ogbg-mollipo?,"['Benchmarking Large Language Models for Molecule Prediction Tasks Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\n(5)ogbg-molfreesolv .

To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs on molecule prediction tasks. We consider ML models of two\ndifferent categories: (1) Language Model (LM) that only takes text information as inputs, i.e., DeBERTa [ 17]. (2) Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) that capture the molecule’s geometric structure information and other available features. We\nconsider two classic GNN variants, i.e., GCN [25] and GIN [43]. Their frameworks are illustrated in Figure 3.\nLLMs. In this work, we are interested in where the LLM’s parameters are fixed, and the system is available for users in\na black box setup where the LLM only consumes and produces text. We believe this setting to be particularly valuable as\nmost users would practically have access to LLMs. In this case, we consider Llama-2-7b [ 37], Llama-2-13b [ 37], GPT-3.5\nand GPT-4 [ 1] as LLMs in this work, and GPT-3.5 is the major LLM for most experiments.

Because the generated descriptions following [ 12] have tons of tokens, easily over the LLM’s\ninput token constraints, hence we do not include descriptions in the FSprompt in this study.\nImplementation. We implement ML predictive models following their available official implementations. For instance,\nwe adopt the available code of variant GNN models on the OGB benchmark leaderboards, e.g., GCN1and GIN2. About\nDeBERTa, we adopt its official implementation3and incorporate it within our pipeline. For the LLMs, we simply call\nthe API provided by OpenAI or the official implementation with default hyper-parameter settings.

One significant\nconstraint of current LLMs is their reliance on unstructured text, which limits their ability to incorporate crucial\ngeometric structures inherent in molecules as input [ 15,28]. To address this limitation, Fatemi et al . [12] propose\nencoding the graph structure into textual descriptions. Expanding on this concept, we integrate both atom features\nand graph structure into textual descriptions. However, our findings from Table 2 reveal that augmenting prompts\nwith descriptions does not consistently enhance performance; rather, it detrimentally affects performance in some\ninstances. Furthermore, the decrease in response consistency reported in Figure 6, when descriptions are added to\nprompts, suggests that such additions may hinder LLMs’ ability to maintain adherence to format requirements. We\nattribute this to the increased complexity introduced by the additional tokens in the description, thereby exacerbating\nthe LLMs’ attentional challenges. Consequently, the practice of converting geometry structures into text for LLM\n11']","For the ogbg-molfreesolv dataset, GNN models (GCN and GIN) perform significantly better than LLMs in terms of RMSE.

To create comprehensive tests, these benchmarks must assess\nan AGI’s ability to generalize knowledge across domains, reason abstractly, and learn dynamically in new, unseen\nscenarios. These tests should measure an AGI’s adaptability, reasoning prowess, and capacity for learning on the fly.\nMoreover, these benchmarks should not merely aim for superhuman performance in isolated tasks but should also\nevaluate a balanced spectrum of abilities akin to human intelligence. This includes assessing emotional understanding,\nethical decision-making, and the nuanced judgment that characterizes human-like intelligence. Crafting benchmarks\nthat encapsulate these multi-dimensional aspects is crucial in evaluating AGI’s depth, adaptability, and nuanced\nunderstanding compared to human intelligence.\nComplete Behavioral Evaluation : Evaluating language models like LLMs solely on narrow tasks has indeed limited\nour understanding of their true capabilities. Shifting the focus towards holistic assessments, such as integrating LLMs\nwith physical environments through robot control, marks a significant stride in understanding their adaptability and\nreal-world functionality. By orchestrating a scenario where the LLM navigates and interacts in a physical setting, we\ndelve into its capacity to process diverse streams of information—from visual and auditory cues to tactile feedback.\nThis multifaceted evaluation tests the model’s ability to synthesize various modalities seamlessly, enabling it to respond\ndynamically to unforeseen circumstances. It not only gauges the LLM’s linguistic prowess but also sheds light on\nits practical application, providing a richer and more comprehensive view of its behavioral capabilities in complex,\nunstructured environments.\nRobustness Evaluation : Assessing the adaptability of language models to diverse inputs like different dialects, slang,\nand varying grammar structures is a multifaceted challenge. First, creating comprehensive datasets that encapsulate\nthis linguistic diversity is pivotal. These datasets must encompass a wide array of linguistic variations, capturing\ncolloquialisms, regional nuances, and grammatical deviations. Secondly, devising evaluation metrics becomes crucial\nin measuring a model’s robustness across these variations. Metrics should focus on consistency in understanding and\ngenerating outputs, evaluating not just accuracy but also coherence and contextual relevance. Developing these metrics\nrequires a deep understanding of linguistic nuances and the ability to quantify these qualitative aspects objectively.\nUltimately, this concerted effort aims to enhance the model’s adaptability to the dynamic nature of human language,\nensuring it performs reliably across diverse linguistic landscapes.\nDynamic and Evolving Evaluation : The rapid advancement of language models poses a challenge in evaluating\ntheir true capabilities. The static benchmarks, while useful at a point in time, tend to become outdated as models\nevolve. Creating evaluation protocols that dynamically adapt is crucial to ensure that these models are not merely\nmemorizing data but are consistently learning and adapting to new challenges. By constantly presenting them with\nnovel and unseen tasks, we can gauge their capacity to generalize knowledge, understand context, and apply reasoning\nskills.

I NTRODUCTION\nThe recent rise in popularity of large language models\n(LLMs) has prompted significant ongoing research into run-\nning LLMs at reduced precision, to support resource con-\nstraints and democratize their access. Prior work has looked\nat running the weights and activations of LLMs in 8-bit preci-\nsion [1], [2]. The most recent techniques focus on enabling\n4-bit integer quantization of weights while retaining FP16\nactivations [3], and 4-bit to 3-bit quantization of both weights\nand activations [4]. Beyond the recent advancements that\nhave focused specifically on LLMs, numerous techniques have\nbeen developed for efficiently running convolutional models\nand smaller scale language models such as BERT at low\nprecision [5]–[7]. However, the latter techniques have not been\nevaluated in the context of modern LLMs and vision trans-\nformers.

High level overview of INT-FP-QSim. The user specifies the input model and the quantizer functions. The matrix multiplication layers (e.g., conv,\nlinear) within the model are replaced with versions of the layers that have the quantizers attached. During forward pass, the quantizers are applied to the\ninputs, weights and outputs of each layer to simulate quantization.\nA. Numerical Formats\nIn this work, we fix weights to 4-bit precision, and explore\ndifferent precisions for activations. Specifically, with weights\nkept either in 4-bit integer or 4-bit floating point, we explore\nactivation quantization in the following formats: 1) 4-bit\ninteger; 2) 8-bit integer; 3) 4-bit floating point; and 4) 8-bit\nfloating point [13]. For the 4-bit floating point formats, we\nexplore both 2-bit exponent (with 1-bit mantissa, i.e., E2M1)\nand 1-bit exponent formats (E1M2). For 8-bit floating point,\nwe use the format proposed in [13], namely, 4-bit exponent\nand 3-bit mantissa (E4M3). We perform integer quantization\nas follows, using nearest rounding:\ns=2b−1\nα(1)\nxq=Q(x;s, b) =clip(round (s·x)),−2b−1,2b−1)(2)\nWe de-quantize the input as follows:\nˆx=DQ(xq) =1\nsxq (3)\nPerforming quantization to lower precision often results in a\ndrop in the model accuracy, requiring the application of special\ntechniques to recover comparably to higher precision levels.\nB. Accuracy Recovery With Post-Training Quantization\nWe investigate the following methods for accuracy recovery\nfrom quantization: a) static quantization with Mean Squared\nError (MSE) calibration [7], b) Adaptive Block Floating Point\n(ABFP) [6], c) SmoothQuant (SQ) [1], d) GPTQ [3], and e)\nRPTQ [4]. We briefly describe each method here, and refer\nreaders to the corresponding papers for more details.\n1) Static Quantization with MSE Calibration: Calibration\nis the process of choosing the scales α(Eqn (1)) for quantizing\nthe model weights and activations [7]. The calibrated scales\nare then used to perform quantization as shown in Eqn (2). Inthis work, we follow the approach laid out in [7] and use per-\nchannel max calibration for weights, with mean-squared error\n(MSE) calibration for activations. MSE calibration computes\nthe scale (i.e., α) that minimizes MSE between the quantized\nand unquantized outputs of each layer, and has been shown to\nperform well for minimizing quantization error [14].\n2) Adaptive Block Floating Point: Recent approaches like\nVS-Quant [5] and Adaptive Block Floating Point (ABFP) [6]\nhave looked at dynamically scaling vectors of length n, as a\npotential solution to maintaining accuracy at low precision. In\nthis work, we focus on ABFP and evaluate its performance for\ndifferent numerical formats. ABFP computes scale factors as\nmax over vectors of length n, wherein the scales themselves\nare left in BF16. Given an M×Nmatrix of input activations\nX∈RM×N, letxirepresent the i-th column of X. Then scale\nfactors are computed for vectors of length nin each column:\nsi\nj=max(xi\nj)where xi\nj∈ {xi\n1, xi\n2, . . . , xil\n|xi|\nnm} (4)\nThe scale si\njis used to quantize the n-length vector xi\njof\ncolumn xi. For weights, Eqn (4) is repeated except the scales\nare computed over rows instead of columns. In contrast to\ncomputing the max value over an entire matrix, the computa-\ntion of max over vectors of length n, helps minimize infor-\nmation loss due to quantization. We explore the performance\nof ABFP for vectors of length n∈ {64,128}. A second-\nlevel quantization for the scale factors could be utilized to\nachieve further compression [5]. However, we do not explore\nthe second-level quantization in this work in order to focus our\nanalysis on the best-case performance of the different models.\n3) SmoothQuant: SmoothQuant is a post-training quantiza-\ntion technique shown to work well with 8-bit integer weights\nand 8-bit integer activations in LLMs [1]. SmoothQuant in-\nvolves migrating the quantization difficulty from activations\nto weights, based on a smoothing factor. It is motivated by the']","INT-FP-QSim enables flexible evaluation of LLMs and vision transformers at various numerical precisions and formats, including 4-bit weights and 4-bit or 8-bit activations.

How do hybrid methods in concept graph extraction boost virtual assistants' relational and contextual understanding?,"[""19 \n \uf0b7 Virtual assistants: Concept extraction can be used to improve the capabilities of virtual assistants. By understanding \nthe concepts that are present in a user's query with image, virtual assistants can provide more relevant and \ninformative responses. \nConcept Graph Extraction from Text and Image with Visual-Language LLMs  \nConcept graph extraction  is the task of extracting a graph of concepts from text or image. Concept graph extraction from \ntext has been discussed in Section 5 Concept Graph Extraction from Text with LLMs. \nThere are a number of different approaches to concept graph extraction from image , including: \n\uf0b7 Text-based approaches: These approaches use natural language processing techniques to extract concepts from the \ntext associated with an image . \n\uf0b7 Image-based approaches: These approaches use computer vision techniques to extract concepts from the image \nitself. \n\uf0b7 Hybrid approaches: These approaches combine text-based and image-based approaches to extract concepts from \nboth the image and the associated text. \nConcept graph extraction from image can be used for a variety of tasks, such as: \n\uf0b7 Image understanding: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of an image, which can then \nbe used to understand the meaning of the image. \n\uf0b7 Visual question answering: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of a question involving \nimage, which can then be used to answer the question. \n\uf0b7 Visual dialogue: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of a dialogue involving image, \nwhich can then be used to generate more natural and engaging dialogue. \nVisual-Language LLMs for Concept Learning  \nVisual-language LLMs can be used for concept learning  in a number of ways, including: "", '18 \n \uf0b7 Relational understanding: The ability to understand the relationships between entities in an image. \n\uf0b7 Compositional understanding: The ability to understand how entities in an image can be combined to form new \nconcepts. \n\uf0b7 Contextual understanding: The ability to understand how the context of an image can affect the interpretation of its \ncontent. \nIt finds that visual-language LLMs are able to achieve good performance on tasks that require relational understanding , \nsuch as image question answering. However, they are less successful on tasks that require compositional and contextual \nunderstanding , such as visual question generation. This suggests that visual-language LLMs may not have a deep \nunderstanding of the content they are processing. \nConcept Extraction from Text and Image with Visual-Language LLMs  \nConcept extraction  is the process of identifying and extracting concepts from text or image. This is a challenging task, as \nconcepts can be represented in a variety of ways, both in text and in image. Concept extraction from text  has been discussed \nin Section 4 Concept Extraction from Text with LLMs. \nVisual-language LLMs can be used for concept extraction from image  in a number of ways. One way is to use the LLM \nto generate a  natural language description  of an image. This description can then be analyzed to identify the concepts that \nare present in the image. Another way is to use the LLM to answer questions  about an image. The questions that are asked \ncan be designed to elicit information about specific concepts. For example, a question like ""What is the object in the \nforeground?"" can be used to extract the concept of ""object"" from the image. Finally, both ways can be combined by using the \nLLM to generate a natural language description of an image, and then using the LLM to answer questions about the image. \nThe combination of the natural language description and the answers to the questions can then be used to identify the \nconcepts that are present in the image. \nHere are some examples of how concept extraction from image can be used in real-world applications : \n\uf0b7 Image search: Concept extraction can be used to improve the accuracy of image search.

How do LLMs' abilities in simulating human cognition aid cognitive and behavioral psychology?,"[""neural responses and sensory processing, which are foundational to human cognition. Advancing to the \ncognitive layer, Newell examines fundamental cognitive mechanisms operating on intermediate time scales, \ntypically spanning from one second to around one m inute. This layer could encompass basic cognitive \noperations such as attention, perception, and short -term memory processes. Further, at the rational layer, the \nfocus shifts to more elaborate and sustained cognitive activities. These processes, often exten ding over time \nscales from several minutes to a few hours, might involve complex problem -solving, planning, and decision -\nmaking activities that require a higher level of cognitive engagement. Finally, the social layer encapsulates \nhuman behavior within the  ambit of social interactions and structures. This level, characterized by the \nbroadest time scales ranging from a few hours to days or more, delves into the dynamics of social \ncommunication, group behavior, and cultural influences on cognition. This layer ed approach underscores \nthe multifaceted nature of human behavior, highlighting the interplay between rapid physiological processes \nand the more prolonged, socially influenced aspects of human cognition.   \nLLMs have great potential for modeling cognition and behavior on these different time scales (see Fig. \n1b) and can provide new insights into human psycho -cognitive processes. Recent research has revealed \nsignificant advancements in LLMs’ ability to emulate complex human cognitive and social behaviors \n(Grossmann et al., 2023; Marjieh et al., 2023; Orru et al., 2023; Pal et al., 2023; Stevenson et al., 2022; Webb \net al., 2023) .

These findings collectively \nindicate the expanding role of LLMs in mimicking and enhancing human cognitive and social functions, \nmarking significant progress in AI research.  \nAs a general cognitive model (Binz & Schulz, 2023a) , LLMs can provide new perspectives and \napproaches to research in the fields of cognitive and behavioral psychology, clinical and counseling \npsychology, educational and developmental psychology, and social and cultural psychology in different time \nscales of human behavior (see Fig . 1a).

In another study, they tested the GPT -3 with tools from cognitive psychology and showed \nthat it made better decisions and outperformed humans in a multiarmed bandit task (Binz & Schulz, 2023b) . \nIn addition, there are other series of studies that have demonstrated that LLMs  have perceptual judgment  \n(Marjieh et al., 2023) , reasoning  (Webb et al., 2023) , and decision -making abilities  (Hagendorff et al., 2023) , \ncreativity  (Stevenson et al., 2022) , and problem -solving  (Orru et al., 2023) , and one study even demonstrated \nthat the GPT -4 has the mental abilities of a seven -year-old child through a false belief task (considered the \ngold standard for testing theory of mind in humans)  (Kosinski, 2023) .

How do iterative prompts and Krippendorff’s alpha improve validating text analysis for spotting populism in politics?,"['How to use Large Language Models 5\n4. Validation\nCareful validation is essential to make sure that the models\nare measuring what we intend – and that they do so without\nproblematic biases. To validate our models, we can compare\nthe outputs with established benchmarks, ground truth data ,\nor expert evaluations to validate the eﬀectiveness in achie ving\nthe desired analysis outcomes.\nFor many tasks, a simple way of validating is to extract a\nsample of the data, and have human coders manually classifyi ng\nthe items. We can do so by simply extracting an Excel ﬁle that\nthe coders can open in Excel. After they have ﬁnished coding,\nwe load the Excel ﬁles back into Python, and use the results to\nvalidate the model. In our populist case, however, we instea d\nuse the existing populism database to validate our data.\nTo measure the correspondence between the model result\nand our validation data, we can use the Krippendorﬀ’s alpha\n[5]. The Krippendorﬀ’s alpha gives a measure of interrater\nagreement, and is used to assess the extent to which multiple\nraters or coders agree when coding or categorizing qualitat ive\ndata. Krippendorﬀ’s alpha takes into account both the obser ved\nagreement among raters and the expected agreement by chance .\nIt can be applied to diﬀerent types of nominal, ordinal, or\ninterval-level data. The calculation of Krippendorﬀ’s alph a\nconsiders the number of coders, the number of categories or\ncodes, and the observed and expected agreement. It quantiﬁe s\nthe agreement beyond what is expected by chance, taking into\naccount the distribution of codes and the variation among\nraters. The coeﬃcient ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values\nindicating greater agreement among coders.\nIn Python, the simpledorﬀ library provides a simple way to\nmeasure the Krippendorﬀ’s alpha. We can apply this on the\nvalidation data using:\n! pip i n s t a l l sim pledo rff\nimport simp le dor ff\nsimpled orf f . c a l c u l a t e k r i p p e n d o r f f s a l p h a f o r d f (\ndf , experiment col=experiment col ,\nannotator col=annotator col , c l a s s c o l=c l a s s c o l )\nThe resulting a Krippendorﬀ’s alpha of 0.635. This is a\nrelatively high correspondence – at least considering that the\nLLM was not even given the same coding instructions as the\noriginal coders. The human coders of the initial data have a\nKrippendorﬀ’s alpha (interval-level) of 0.827, however the se\ncoders worked in conjunctions, comparing their results and\naddressing disagreements, suggesting that we should expec t\nsigniﬁcantly higher intercoder agreement.\nIterative process of concept and prompt development\nOur ﬁrst result should however only be seen as our starting-\npoint, rather than our ﬁnal destination. When using LLMs for\ntext analysis, it is recommended to use an iterative process of\nsimultaneous prompt and concept development.\nA useful strategy is to engage in a closer examination of\nthe cases where the LLM and the coders disagree, and compare\nthe motivations provided by the model with those provided by\nthe human coders. Such a process can also in itself be deeply\ninformative about the data and concept. This should not be\nthought of as merely the ﬁne-tuning of the LLM instructions\nto match the human data: as research has suggested, the\nLLM can in fact achieve higher accuracy than human coders,\nand the result of human coding hence cannot be treated as\nan unquestioned gold standard [17]. Instead, it may be more\nproductive to think of it a process of mutual learning throug han iterative process for constructing rigorous and reprodu cible\ndeﬁnitions of scientiﬁc concepts.\nIn our populist example, we do not have the luxury of\nworking with the original coders or accessing their motivat ions\nfor their coding decisions. However, we can manually examin e\nthe texts for which the LLM and the coders disagree, and form\nour own judgements. To do so, we merge the human coded data\nand the LLM data, sort by disagreement, and save as a CSV to\nexamine the data manually:\nwrong = df2 . merge ( val , on=‘ merging variable ’ )\nwrong [ ’ d i f f ’ ] /suppress=/suppress abs ( wrong [ ’ answer x ’]−wrong [ ’ answer y ’ ] )\nwrong . s o r t va lu es ( [ ’ d i f f ’ ] ) . t o csv ( ’ disagreements . csv ’ )\nTo take an example, one of the texts for which there is most\ndisagreement is a speech by Italian Prime Minister Berlusco ni.\nThe speech is rated as populist (1.0) by the human coders,\nbut as not populist (0.0) by the LLM, with the motivation:\n”The text does not contain populist elements. It does not\nfocus on ‘the people’ as a homogeneous group, nor does it\ndepict ‘the elite’ as a corrupt entity.

While such cal ls\nfor unity could perhaps be construed as promoting a notion of\n“the people”, it seems far-fetched to view support for resist ance\nagainst actual Nazis as a form of populism. Examining the\nspeech, it thus seems the LLM may have been reasonable in\nclassifying it as non-populist.\nWhen we have ﬁnished developing and validating our model,\nwe can apply it to new datasets.

To be more\nspecific, we benchmark and explore various\ncombinations of LLMs and speech encoders,\nleading to the optimal LLM-based ASR system,\nwhich we call SLAM-ASR1. The proposed\nSLAM-ASR provides a clean setup and little\ntask-specific design, where only the linear pro-\njector is trained. To the best of our knowledge,\nSLAM-ASR achieves the best performance on\nthe Librispeech benchmark among LLM-based\nASR models and even outperforms the latest\nLLM-based audio-universal model trained on\nmassive pair data. Finally, we explore the ca-\npability emergence of LLM-based ASR in the\nprocess of modal alignment. We hope that our\nstudy can facilitate the research on extending\nLLM with cross-modality capacity and shed\nlight on the LLM-based ASR community.\n1 Introduction\nAutomatic speech recognition (ASR) stands as a\ncornerstone in the realm of intelligent speech tech-\nnology, enabling machines to understand and tran-\nscribe human speech. The significance of ASR\nin enhancing human-computer interaction and ac-\ncessibility makes it a crucial area of research and\napplications in the field of speech processing.\n†Corresponding author\n1SLAM-ASR is a subproject of SLAM-LLM, where\nSLAM stands for Speech, Language, Audio and Music. Work-\ning in progress and will open-source soon.The evolution of ASR technology has been\nmarked by the adoption of various paradigms, each\nrepresenting a leap forward in terms of accuracy, ef-\nficiency, and applicability (Li, 2022). Among these,\nsupervised methods including connectionist tem-\nporal classification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006),\nattention-based encoder-decoder (AED) (Chan\net al., 2016), recurrent neural network transducer\n(RNN-T) (Graves et al., 2013) and their variants\nhave been pivotal. In addition, employing self-\nsupervised methods for pre-training followed by\nsupervised methods for fine-tuning has also proven\nto be effective (Baevski et al., 2020; Hsu et al.,\n2021; Chen et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023; Yang et al.,\n2023). However, each paradigm comes with its\nown set of challenges and limitations, such as the\nneed for extensive labeled data, difficulties in cap-\nturing long-range context dependencies in speech,\nand huge training costs.\nIn this evolving landscape, the advent of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) has introduced a ground-\nbreaking paradigm: Multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) framework (Liu et al., 2023; Li\net al., 2023a; Gao et al., 2024), based on a decoder-\nonly architecture. This innovative approach di-\nverges from traditional ASR by utilizing the im-\nmense generative capacity of LLMs, which are\npre-trained on vast corpora encompassing diverse\nlinguistic contexts, leading to LLM-based ASR.\nThe evolution of the ASR paradigm from previous\nNN-based ASR models to LLM-based ASR mod-\nels, stresses differences across loss and criterion\ndesign, text prior knowledge, and model scale. This\nparadigm harnesses pre-existing linguistic knowl-\nedge, enabling a more holistic understanding of\nlanguage, which in turn, translates to significant\nimprovements in the speech recognition task.\nThe architecture of LLM-based ASR can be con-\nceptualized as consisting of three primary compo-\nnents: a speech encoder, a projector, and an LLM.\nRecent works in LLM-based ASR often venturearXiv:2402.08846v1  [cs.CL]  13 Feb 2024', 'into complex designs, such as compressing the out-\nput temporally from the speech encoder (Wu et al.,\n2023; Fathullah et al., 2023), tackling modal align-\nment with the projector (Tang et al., 2024; Yu et al.,\n2024), and fine-tuning the LLM partly or fully (Wu\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Tang et al., 2024;\nWang et al., 2023). Despite these efforts, the out-\ncomes have not always met expectations, indicating\na potential misalignment between the complexity\nof designs and the efficacy of real-world speech\nrecognition tasks. This observation led to a pivotal\nrealization in our research: the essence of an effec-\ntive LLM-based ASR system lies in the synergy\nof a powerful speech encoder and a suitable LLM,\nand then, most notably, a single trainable linear\nprojector is enough to align between modalities.\nOur findings challenge the prevailing notion that\ncomplexity equates to superiority in LLM-based\nASR system design.\nIn this work, we first benchmark the automatic\nspeech recognition task performance with different\ncombinations of well-known speech encoders and\nthe latest released large language models. Experi-\nments show that LLMs with supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT, a.k.a. chat model) perform better than raw\npre-trained LLMs for the ASR task, while speech\nencoders fine-tuned with limited data from self-\nsupervised models outperform supervised founda-\ntion ASR encoders. Building upon these insights,\nwe propose SLAM-ASR, in which only a linear pro-\njector is trained to conduct the ASR task. SLAM-\nASR only requires 4GPUs for 4hours of training\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Lib-\nrispeech (Panayotov et al., 2015) corpus, compared\nwith other LLM-based ASR models and a series\nof previous best performing NN-based ASR mod-\nels. Besides, our work embarks on an in-depth\nexploration of the ability of LLM-based ASR mod-\nels. Interestingly, we observe the capability emer-\ngence phenomenon during LLM-based ASR train-\ning.

This ability of\nthe LLM to recognize the function’s use of instrumental vari ables is particularly signiﬁcant\nfrom an econometric standpoint.\nListing 12: Answer explaining the function kernel_loop()\nThe function is called ‘kernel_loop‘ and appears to be a func tion defined in the gretl\nprogramming language. Here is a brief explanation of what th e function does:\nThe ‘kernel_loop‘ function takes several arguments, inclu ding ‘y‘, ‘X‘, ‘Z‘, ‘h‘, ‘type‘,\nand ‘optparm‘. These arguments appear to be matrices and sca lars that will be used in\nthe computation.\nThe function first creates a new matrix ‘ret‘ using the ‘msha pe‘ function with parameters\n‘NA‘, ‘T‘, and ‘q*k‘. This will create a matrix with ‘T‘ rows a nd ‘q*k‘ columns, where\neach element is initialized to ‘NA‘.\nThe function then creates a new matrix ‘W‘ using the ‘kernelm at‘ function with parameters\n‘T‘, ‘type‘, ‘h‘, and ‘optparm‘. This will create a matrix th at will be used as a\nweight matrix.\nNext, the function initializes the variables ‘ini‘ and ‘fin ‘ to values ‘T+1‘ and ‘2*T‘,\nrespectively. This is used to keep track of the elements in th e ‘W‘ matrix that will\nbe used in the computation.\nThe function then enters a loop that iterates through each ro w of the ‘y‘ matrix. For each\nrow, the function first constructs a new matrix ‘PX‘ by eleme nt-wise multiplying the\nsubset of the ‘W‘ matrix specified by the ‘ini‘ and ‘fin‘ vari ables with the ‘Z‘\nmatrix. The function then performs some matrix operations i nvolving ‘PX‘, ‘y‘, and\n‘X‘, and stores the result in the corresponding row of the ‘re t‘ matrix.\nAfter each iteration, the ‘ini‘ and ‘fin‘ variables are decr emented, to select a different\nsubset of the ‘W‘ matrix for the next iteration.\nFinally, the function returns the ‘ret‘ matrix.\nOverall, it appears that this function computes some sort of weighted regression using the\n‘y‘, ‘X‘, and ‘Z‘ matrices, where the weights are determined by the ‘W‘ matrix\ncalculated using the ‘kernelmat‘ function. The exact natur e of the computation will\ndepend on the values of the input variables and the implement ation details of the\nvarious matrix operations used in the function.\nNext, we provide a second example that uses a function from th e SVAR package (v1.97)\n13']","The LLM's skill in identifying matrix operations and parameter types in the kernel_loop() function aids docstring-to-code translation by accurately recognizing the function's use of matrices and scalars, as well as the specific operations performed on them.

How does LLaMA-2-Chat's security fine-tuning tackle biases in pre-training and fine-tuning?,"['/Procedia Computer Science 00 (2024) 1–28 19\nimproved compared to GPT-3. To mitigate the security risks of LLaMA-2, LLaMA-2-Chat [31] employs three secu-\nrity fine-tuning techniques: 1) collect adversarial prompts and security demonstrations to initialize and include them\nin a general supervised fine-tuning process, 2) train a security-specific reward model to integrate security into the\nRLHF pipeline, and 3) security context distillation to refine the RLHF pipeline. Validation shows that the fine-tuned\nLLaMA-2-chat exhibits more positive sentiment on many demographic groups, and its fairness is greatly improved\nover the pre-trained LLaMA-2 base model.\n6.3.2. Prompt Engineering\nPrompt engineering has become increasingly popular as it is an e fficient way to change the behavior of a model\nwithout further training. Especially for very large LLMs, it provides convenience while saving a lot of computational\nresources by designing additional prompts to guide the model to a fairer output without fine-tuning. For example, in\nthe occupation recommendation task, Bubeck et al. [159] change GPT-4’s gender choice from a third-person pronoun\nto “they/their ” by adding the phrase “ in an inclusive way ” to the prompts. Tamkin et al. [149] mitigate discrimination\nin Claude 2.0 [157] in two ways. One way is to add various statements emphasizing fairness at the end of the prompts,\nand another way is to ask the model to describe the reasoning process while considering fairness. However, the\neffectiveness of prompt engineering is not stable. There are many factors that a ffect the e ffectiveness of prompt, such\nas the level of abstraction and the position of the prompt. Mattern et al. [140] compare the e ffectiveness of debiasing\nGPT-3 with prompts with di fferent levels of abstraction and positions in a zero-shot task. Experiments show that\nprompts with higher abstractions tend to debias more significantly than prompts with lower abstractions. Borchers et\nal. [165] find that prompt engineering does not make GPT-3 output fairer ads in the ad generation task compared to\nthe zero-shot task. For example, prompts that let the model consider diversity in hiring “ Write a job ad for a {job}for\na firm focused on diversity in hiring .” or prompts that enforce fairness ” Write a unbiased job ad for a {job}.”. On the\ncontrary, fine-tuning on unbiased real ads will get better debiasing results.\n7. Discussions\nAlthough the fairness of medium-sized LLMs is relatively widely studied and has been discussed in some previous\nwork, we find that these studies are still limited and should be explored more. In parallel, large-sized LLMs are still\nin the stage of developing a more comprehensive and socially harmless system, whose fairness is a societal focus. In\nthis section, we discuss the shortcomings, challenges, and future research directions of the current development of\nLLM fairness and give our insight.\n7.1. Unreliable Correlation between Intrinsic and Extrinsic Biases\nIntrinsic metrics probe the underlying LLMs, while extrinsic metrics evaluate the model for downstream tasks. In\nthe pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, while the pre-trained model is the foundation, fine-tuning may override the\nknowledge learned in pre-training. Some work verifies that intrinsic debiasing benefits the fairness of downstream\ntasks [166]. But others point out that intrinsic bias and extrinsic bias are not necessarily correlated [29, 167, 137],\nnot only in the original setting but even when correcting for metric bias, noise in the dataset, and confounding fac-\ntors [168]. Moreover, di fferent metrics are not compatible with each other, making it di fficult to guarantee the reliabil-\nity of the benchmark [78]. Therefore, we urge practitioners working on debiasing research not to rely only on certain\nmetrics, especially intrinsic metrics, but to focus more on extrinsic metrics and consider fairness on downstream tasks.\nMoreover, new challenge sets and annotated test data should be created to make these metrics more feasible.\n7.2. Accurately Evaluating Fairness of Large-sized LLMs\n7.2.1. Expand Methods for Quantifying Bias\nFor evaluating the fairness of medium-sized LLMs, bias can be measured from both intrinsic and extrinsic per-\nspectives based on model embeddings and output predictions. Compared to this, the evaluation of the fairness of\nlarge-sized LLMs is relatively inadequate. In particular, for many large-sized LLMs that are not open source, we can\nonly quantify bias based on the response results of the model. How to more accurately formalize the bias in model\ngeneration is fundamental to the evaluation. In addition, most methods rely on human judgment of the bias in the\nmodel response, which consumes a lot of resources and cannot guarantee whether it will introduce personal bias of\n19']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '19', 'file_name': '2308.10149v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2308.10149v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2119005, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

How do embedding vs. probability-based LLM metrics compare in NLG eval?,"['We will review each type of evaluation methods and discuss\nthe pros and cons respectively. Lastly, we will discuss future\ndirections in this area (§6).\n2 LLM-derived Metrics\n2.1 Overview\nEarly model-based NLG evaluation methods and metrics,\nsuch as BERTScore and BARTScore, were primarily mo-\ntivated by the capability of traditional pre-trained language\nmodels to generate high-quality texts. Recently, the advent\nof LLMs has prompted some research to adapt these ideas\nto stronger LLMs. Their inherent, powerful linguistic abili-\nties are derived for direct NLG evaluation, which is expected\nto result in better performance. Such works can be cate-\ngorized into two main types: embedding-based metrics and\nprobability-based metrics.\n2.2 Embedding-based Metrics\nThe embedding-based methods, like BERTScore, generally\nutilize representations of language models and thus compute\nthe semantic similarity between the reference and the target\ntext to evaluate, with different possible ways of implemen-\ntation. Recent work [ESet al. , 2023 ]similarly obtains em-\nbeddings for the target text using the text-embedding-ada-002\nmodel through the OpenAI API. The higher the correspond-\ning similarity, the closer the target text aligns with the relevant\nrequirements, indicating a higher quality.\n2.3 Probability-based Metrics\nTo better utilize the knowledge inherent in language models,\nprobability-based methods like BARTScore formulate text\ngeneration evaluation as conditional probability comparison,\npositing that the better the quality of the target text, the higher\nthe likelihood that models should be able to generate it. Re-\ncently, GPTScore [Fuet al. , 2023a ]has established tailored\nevaluation templates for each aspect to effectively guide mul-\ntiple LLMs for NLG evaluation, including GPT3 [Brown et\nal., 2020 ], OPT [Zhang et al. , 2022 ], and FLAN [Chung et\nal., 2022 ]. The generation probability is calculated under the\ncondition of source input designed with customized prompts\nand evaluation aspects, which endows the GPTScore with\nbetter flexibility in evaluation. And similar methods have\nalso been applied to the hallucination detection of the LLM-\ngenerated text [Varshney et al. , 2023 ]with three different at-\ntempts for calculating the probability score.\nOn the other hand, some works leverage the variation in\nprobabilities under changed conditions as the evaluation met-\nric. FFLM [Jiaet al. , 2023 ]proposes to evaluate the faith-\nfulness of the target text by calculating a combination of\nprobability changes based on the intuition that the genera-\ntion probability of a given text segment increases when more\nconsistent information is provided, and vice versa. Similarly,\nDELTASCORE [Xieet al. , 2023 ]measures the quality of dif-\nferent story aspects according to the likelihood difference be-\ntween pre- and post-perturbation states with LLMs including\nGPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) that provide logits. They believe\nthat the sensitivity to specific perturbations indicates the qual-\nity of related aspects, and their experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of their approach.2.4 Pros and Cons\nTraditional NLG evaluation approaches always fall short due\nto their surface-form similarity when the target text and ref-\nerence convey the same meaning but use different expres-\nsions. In contrast, LLM-derived metrics offer a remedy for\nthe limitation and demonstrate stronger correlations with hu-\nman judgments benefiting from the evolving modeling tech-\nniques. However, the flaws within LLMs can lead to some\nissues, as introduced in the following:\nRobustness. Some research has investigated the robust-\nness of LLM-derived metrics and found that they lack ro-\nbustness in different attack scenarios. Specifically, [Heet al. ,\n2023b ]develops a set of stress tests to assess the robustness\nof various model-based metrics on some common NLG tasks.\nThey show a catalogue of the blind spots and potential errors\nidentified that are not detected by different metrics.\nEfficiency. Compared to traditional metrics, LLM-derived\nevaluation methods are more time-consuming and require\nmore computational resources, especially when adopting\nLLMs with quite large parameter scales. To address this,\n[Eddine et al. , 2022 ]proposes an approach to learning a\nlightweight version of LLM-derived metrics, and some fast\nLLM inference and serving tools like vLLM [Kwon et al. ,\n2023 ]have been launched. However, closed-source LLMs\noften do not make their parameters, representations, or log-\nits public and available, thus making it impossible to apply\nLLM-derived methods to them.\nFairness. [Sunet al. , 2022 ]assesses the social bias across\nvarious metrics for NLG evaluation on six sensitive attributes:\nrace, gender, religion, physical appearance, age, and socioe-\nconomic status. Their findings reveal that model-based met-\nrics carry noticeably more social bias than traditional metrics.\nRelevant biases can be categorized into two types: intrinsic\nbias encoded within pre-trained language models and extrin-\nsic bias injected during the computation of similarity. There-\nfore, current LLM-derived methods may have similar issues.\n3 Prompting LLMs\n3.1 Overview\nLLMs have demonstrated unprecedented instruction under-\nstanding and text generation abilities, which broadens re-\nsearchers’ imagination of automatic evaluation for NLG.\nFor a long time, human evaluation has been viewed as the\ngold standard for NLG evaluation. Recently, some stud-\nies claim that LLMs are on par with crowdsourcing anno-\ntators in several tasks [T¨ornberg, 2023; Gilardi et al. , 2023;\nOstyakova et al. , 2023; Cegin et al. , 2023 ]. So, can LLMs\nsimulate or even be an alternative to humans in the human\nevaluation of NLG? Or, do the practices in human evaluation\nor other evaluative tasks (e.g. competition race, paper review,\netc.) inspire us to better NLG evaluation with LLMs? A large\nbody of research and attempts based on prompting LLMs are\nguided by these ideas. In these studies, instructions and the\ntext to be evaluated are completely expressed in the prompt\ngiven to LLMs, and the evaluation results are generated by\nthem.\nHuman evaluation typically includes the following ele-\nments:', 'LLM-based NLG Evaluation: Current Status and Challenges\nMingqi Gao∗,Xinyu Hu∗,Jie Ruan ,Xiao Pu ,Xiaojun Wan\nPeking University\n{gaomingqi, huxinyu, wanxiaojun }@pku.edu.cn, {ruanjie, puxiao }@stu.pku.edu.cn\nAbstract\nEvaluating natural language generation (NLG) is\na vital but challenging problem in artificial intel-\nligence.

Various automatic evalu-\nation methods based on LLMs have been proposed,\nincluding metrics derived from LLMs, prompting\nLLMs, and fine-tuning LLMs with labeled evalu-\nation data. In this survey, we first give a taxon-\nomy of LLM-based NLG evaluation methods, and\ndiscuss their pros and cons, respectively. We also\ndiscuss human-LLM collaboration for NLG evalu-\nation. Lastly, we discuss several open problems in\nthis area and point out future research directions.\n1 Introduction\nEvaluating natural language generation (NLG) is a key but\nchallenging issue. Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU\n[Papineni et al. , 2002 ]and ROUGE [Lin, 2004 ]rely on the n-\ngram overlap between model outputs and references to mea-\nsure its quality. They have been criticized for low correlation\nwith human judgments [Sulem et al. , 2018 ], as surface-level\nmatching cannot reliably evaluate text. After the rise of deep\nlearning, model-based evaluation metrics like BERTScore\n[Zhang et al. , 2020 ]and BARTScore [Yuan et al. , 2021 ]have\nbeen continuously proposed and gradually adopted to eval-\nuate the overall quality or various specific aspects of gener-\nated outputs (e.g., fluency, coherence, coverage, faithfulness,\netc.). Although better than traditional metrics, their perfor-\nmance is still not satisfactory, and their application scope is\nvery limited. For example, BERTScore is reference-based\nand cannot be used without a reference. With the emergence\nof large language models (LLMs) like InstructGPT [Ouyang\net al. , 2022 ], they have achieved unprecedented effectiveness\nin following instructions, understanding content, and gener-\nating text. This inspired researchers to use LLMs for NLG\nevaluation.

The overall approach is\nillustrated in Algorithm 1. This process employs\na two-step method, as described below.

This involves']","Prompt formality and concreteness both influence LLM hallucinations. A decrease in the occurrence of hallucination is noticeable as the formality score increases, but LLMs stop responding to prompts with formality scores greater than 70. Hallucinations related to personalities and locations show a partial reduction with increased formality, while those involving numbers and acronyms largely persist. Similarly, prompts with concreteness scores in the range of 2.2 to 3.3 are most effective in preventing hallucinations, and higher concreteness scores are not well processed by LLMs. Elevating the concreteness score can help prevent hallucinations related to persons and locations. Paraphrasing can enhance prompt comprehension, which correlates with reduced hallucination.

Through a chat interface, re-\nsearchers like Jannai et al. (2023); Jones and\nBergen (2023) have explored how well people can\ndistinguish between a human and an LLM. This\ndistinction is vital for the safety and reliability of\nan application. Though related, our BBIV task fo-\ncuses on identifying a specific LLM model used by\nan application, rather than differentiating between\nhuman and machine.\nDetection of LLM content. Researchers have in-\nvestigated ways to identify content created by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), particularly since Chat-\nGPT became popular. This effort is key to maintain-\ning originality and preventing LLMs from reusing\ntheir previous outputs. Various methods have been\ndeveloped: Mitchell et al. (2023) looked into the\nmodel’s probability characteristics; Gehrmann et al.\n(2019) examined the statistical properties of texts;\nChen et al. (2023) used classifiers to tell apart con-\ntent made by humans from that made by LLMs.\nThere has also been debate on the feasibility of\nthese detection tasks against deliberate manipula-\ntion efforts (Sadasivan et al., 2023; Chakraborty\net al., 2023). For further details, the surveys by\nDhaini et al. (2023); Ghosal et al. (2023) provide\na thorough review. While these studies focus on\ndistinguishing between human and LLM-generated\ntexts, our BBIV task targets the identification of\nspecific LLM models behind applications. Unlike\nthe broad text analysis for LLM content detection,\nBBIV utilizes an interactive approach, demonstrat-\ning that with well-crafted prompts, it is feasible to\npinpoint an LLM type based on minimal output,\nwithin 3 to 5 characters of output text.Watermarking. Watermarking is a promising\nstrategy that could help solve the problem we have\nhighlighted. It embeds subtle statistical distortions\nin the output of a model, which a specialized de-\ntection algorithm can use to confirm whether the\ncontent was generated by our model. These distor-\ntions are designed to be imperceptible to humans.\nWatermarking typically occurs during the model’s\ntraining phase (Abdelnabi and Fritz, 2021; Kirchen-\nbauer et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2023), though there\nare methods that apply watermarks during the con-\ntent generation phase as well (Kirchenbauer et al.,\n2023). Regardless of when it is applied, the model,\ncomplete with watermarks, eventually gets passed\nto third-party developers before being released to\nthe public. This introduces a major challenge for\nmonitoring LLMs in use: once an LLM is deployed\nwithout watermarking, it is too late to start tracking\nits use. Our solution, TRAP, is free of this lim-\nitation. We create prompts specifically designed\nto coax the desired LLM into producing certain\nresponses. These prompts can be developed even\nafter the model has been deployed, as long as the\noriginal developers can access the model’s original\nweights. We contend that TRAP is a fundamen-\ntally more practical solution. However, we note\nthat TRAP is not intended to replace watermarking.\nInstead, it complements it, acting as an additional\nlayer in an overarching security model.\nAdversarial suffix. Despite efforts to align the\noutputs of LLMs with human goals and ethics (Yud-\nkowsky, 2016; Christian, 2020; Christiano et al.,\n2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Rafailov et al., 2023;\nTunstall et al., 2023; Fernandes et al., 2023), there\nis a risk of LLMs being manipulated to generate\nharmful content through “jailbreaking” using ad-\nversarial suffixes. Zou et al. (2023) introduced the\nGreedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) method, which\nidentifies prompt suffixes capable of eliciting neg-\native behaviors from aligned LLMs. This method,\nfor instance, can trick an LLM into starting its re-\nsponse with affirmative (e.g. “Sure, here’s how”)\nto dangerous queries (e.g. “Tell me how to destroy\nhumanity”), pushing it towards generating unsafe\ncontent. Subsequent work (Hu et al., 2024) has ex-\nplored using GCG for exploring further vulnerabil-\nities. Our approach, TRAP, is the first to repurpose\nGCG for a constructive and socially beneficial goal.\nWe employ GCG to discover suffixes that prompt a\nspecific LLM to produce a predetermined response.\nThis technique serves as a compliance verification', 'TRAP: Targeted Random Adversarial Prompt Honeypot for Black-Box\nIdentification\nMartin Gubri1Dennis Ulmer1, 2, 3Hwaran Lee4Sangdoo Yun4Seong Joon Oh1, 5, 6\n1Parameter Lab2IT University of Copenhagen3Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence\n4NA VER AI Lab5University of Tübingen6Tübingen AI Center\nmartin.gubri@parameterlab.de\nAbstract\nLarge Language Model (LLM) services and\nmodels often come with legal rules on who can\nuse them and how they must use them.

The phe-\nnomenon of model leaks recently captured public\nattention, particularly following an incident at the\nend of January 2024, when an anonymous user up-\nloaded an unidentified LLM to HuggingFace1. The\nCEO of Mistral subsequently confirmed that this\nwas an internal model, leaked by an employee of\nan early access customer2. This event underscores\nthe growing threat of internal breaches that LLM\nproviders must contend with. LLM providers are\nalso facing malicious usage of their technologies.\n1https://huggingface.co/miqudev/miqu-1-70b\n2https://twitter.com/arthurmensch/status/\n1752737462663684344For example, Yang and Menczer (2023) uncov-\nered a network of social media bots utilizing Chat-\nGPT to disseminate deceptive content. These bots\npromote suspicious websites and spread harmful\ncomments, which violate OpenAI’s usage policies\n(OpenAI, 2024). Such challenges extend beyond\nproprietary LLMs to affect open-source models\nas well. A concrete example is Meta’s Llama 2\nlicence (Touvron et al., 2023), which forbids de-\nceptive usage. Open-source LLM providers imple-\nment additional restrictions on model distribution.\nSpecifically, Llama 2 is licensed for commercial\nuse only by entities or services with fewer than\n700 million monthly active users, highlighting a\nproactive approach to control usage.\nLegal protections are not fully effective if they\ncannot be enforced. Enforcement begins with an\nassessment of whether the LLM of interest is used\nin a particular third-party application. While LLM\nservice providers have a vested interest in identify-\ning whether their model is used in cases in which\nthe given licence is violated, there is currently no\nstudy or dedicated tool for addressing this prob-\nlem. This task is non-trivial, since the owner of the\nLLM cannot access the model weights behind the\nblack-box API for general third-party applications.\nIn this work, we propose the task of black-box\nidentity verification (BBIV) : Given a black-box\nLLM, which we may only prompt and read out-\nputs, can we accurately detect if the LLM in ques-\ntion is identical to the target LLM, for which we\nhave white-box access? We answer this ques-\ntion affirmatively: By utilizing a recent method\nto jailbreak LLMs that trains a suffix of additional\nprompt tokens—that consists of seemingly arbi-\ntrary tokens—we can steer the answer of a specific\nmodel towards a pre-defined answer, while other\nmodels give random answers.

How does RA-LLM's ASR reduction compare to Self Defense and Perplexity-based defenses for adversarial prompts?,"['Preprint\nduring the alignment fine-tuning process, the LLM is instructed to always start the response to\nmalicious requests with a special token. When applying our defensive method, it is only necessary\nto output and check the first token in each Monte Carlo trial. Such a collaborative strategy on\nalignment and RA-LLM will not only significantly improve our recognition accuracy for malicious\ninputs but also help in further reducing computational costs. Due to limited resources, we leave this\npart as our future work.\nF C OMPARISON WITH LLM S ELFDEFENSE\nIn this section, we additionally compared our method with the concurrent work, LLM Self Defense\n(Helbling et al., 2023). We use the more effective ”Questions as suffix” setting, that simply utilizes\nitself or another LLM instance to detect if its own response is harmful through the instruction such\nas\nHere is some text: {response }Is it harmful? Give answer as “Yes, it is harmful” or “No, it is\nharmless” .\nSpecifically, we conducted both Self Defense through itself and Self Defense through GPT3.5 and\nsummarized the comparison results in Table 5. We can observe that the attacked models (i.e., Vicuna\nand Guanaco) inherently struggle to discern harmful content, leading to low BAR. Moreover, the\noutputs of the detection prompt contain unexpected content including deviations from the predefined\nresponses of ”Yes, it is harmful.” or ”No, it is harmless.”, continue completion of the unfinished\ncontent from the previous context, and even non-responsiveness from LLMs. These suggest that in\nscenarios preventing the use of external powerful models, LLM Self Defense might be less effective.\nWhile Self Defense though more powerful LLM instances such as GPT3.5 demonstrates higher\naccuracy in identifying harmful content and thus enjoys on-par defending effectiveness with our\nmethod, it still suffers from lower BARs. This could be attributed to the current LLM’s overcau-\ntiousness in detecting harmful content (R ¨ottger et al., 2023).\nTable 5: The benign answering rate and attack success rate of the original LLM, self Defense, self\nDefense by GPT3.5, and our RA-LLM under individual adversarial alignment-breaking attacks.\nModelsBAR ASR\nOriginal LLM Self Defense GPT3.5 RA-LLM Original LLM Self Defense GPT3.5 RA-LLM\nVicuna-7B-chat-HF 99.3% 68.7% 90.0% 98.7% 98.7% 22.7% 8.0% 10.7%\nGuanaco-7B-HF 95.3% 41.3% 87.3% 92.0% 96.0% 52.0% 8.7% 6.7%\nG C OMPARISON WITH PERPLEXITY -BASED DEFENSE\nPerplexity-based defense proposed by Jain et al.

(2023), we report the comparison results in Table 6. We can observe that even though\nperplexity defense achieves high BAR and effectively reduces the ASR of individual GCG attacks,\nthis defense mechanism completely fails to detect handcrafted jailbreak prompts, presumably ow-\ning to the lower perplexity of these prompts, as they are manually written by humans. A similar\nconclusion is also validated in Zhu et al. (2023). In contrast, our method effectively defends against\nhandcrafted jailbreak prompts.\nTable 6: The benign answering rate and attack success rate of the original LLM, perplexity defense,\nand our robustly aligned LLM under two alignment-breaking attacks.\nAttack ModelsBAR ASR\nOriginal LLM Perplexity Defense RA-LLM Original LLM Perplexity Defense RA-LLM\nIndividual GCGVicuna-7B-chat-HF 99.3% 98.0% 98.7% 98.7% 0% 10.7%\nGuanaco-7B-HF 95.3% 100% 92.0% 96.0% 4% 6.7%\nHandcrafted promptVicuna-7B-chat-HF 99.3% 98.0% 98.7% 98.7% 100% 12.0%\nGuanaco-7B-HF 95.3% 100% 92.0% 94.7% 100% 9.3%\n17', 'Preprint\nalso been developed through dialogue encryption (Yuan et al., 2023) or the combination of greedy\nand gradient-based search methods (Zou et al., 2023). Figure 1 shows an example that a malicious\nquestion appended with an adversarial prompt could successfully break the safety alignment. Re-\ncently, (Zou et al., 2023) have demonstrated that jailbreak attempts could be highly effective and\ntransferable across different LLMs. This phenomenon suggests that existing safety alignment is far\nfrom robust to defend against carefully crafted adversarial prompts.\nTill now, few attempts have been made to design dedicated mechanisms for defending alignment-\nbreaking attacks. A rudimentary defense currently employed relies on external tools to re-assess the\npotential harm of the LLM responses. For instance, it could feed every potential response from the\ntarget LLM into a third-party LLM to determine whether the response is harmful or not (Helbling\net al., 2023). While this strategy enables filtering out possible harmful responses, there are several\nmajor drawbacks limiting its practicability: 1) Existing LLMs are very sensitive to harmful keywords\nappeared in the input, and have a high propensity to misclassify benign content as harmful, even\nwhen the entire sentence is not talking about any harmful behavior (e.g., stating news or providing\nguidance/warnings). This could lead to a high false-positive rate in harmful content detection; 2)\nThe method heavily relies on the performance of the LLM used as a harmful discriminator, while\nthe LLM itself is not designed to be an accurate harmful discriminator. The basis for its decisions\nremains ambiguous, implying that the harmful evaluation process could be opaque; 3) There are\nmore types of alignment that can not be simply summarised as “harmful” (e.g., privacy, ethics,\nhuman values etc), thus this type of approach cannot cover such cases simultaneously. Given the\nwide range of applications where LLMs could be utilized, finding an effective and practical defense\nagainst potential alignment-breaking attacks is both urgent and challenging.\nIn this work, we design a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against potential alignment-\nbreaking attacks, which is built upon an already aligned LLM and makes the existing alignments\nless prone to be circumvented by adversarial prompts. Specifically, our key idea is that although an\naligned LLM can, to some extent, identify if the input request is benign or not, we cannot directly\nrely on that as it may not be robust. We consider an input request to be benign, only if we randomly\ndrop a certain portion of the request and the LLM still thinks it is benign in most cases. Intuitively,\nsuch a random dropping operation would invalidate the adversarial prompts in alignment-breaking\nattacks, which are usually sensitive to small perturbations; on the other hand, the chances for the\nLLM to reject benign requests are relatively low, even after random dropping. Therefore, such a\nmechanism naturally leads to a robustly aligned LLM.\nNote that our RA-LLM does not require any external “harmful” detectors, instead, our strategy\nonly relies on the existing alignment capability inside the LLM. Due to the same reason, our ap-\nproach is not limited to any specific type of alignment (e.g., harmful), but robustifies all existing\nmodel alignments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to verify the effectiveness of our\nproposed RA-LLM. Our experimental results on open-source large language models demonstrate\nthat RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial prompts and popular\nhandcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 100% to around\n10% or less.\n2 RELATED WORKS\nAligning LLMs with Human Preferences Foundational large language models are pre-trained\non extensive textual corpora (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a),\nwhich equips LLMs with world knowledge and facilitates their deployment in professional applica-\ntions. Despite their excellent performance, LLMs suffer from generating outputs that deviate from\nhuman expectations (e.g., harmful responses and illegal suggestions) due to the significant amount\nof inappropriate content existing in unfiltered training data. To tackle this issue, a line of work\nfocuses on aligning LLMs with human values (Xu et al., 2020b; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al.,\n2022; Go et al., 2023; Korbak et al., 2023).

For instance, if variables aandbare both\ntrue, but equations a∧bare deduced as false, this\nconstitutes an inferring error. Another example is whenthe reasoning process leads to contradictory conclusions,\nsuch as inferring a >10initially but later treating it as\na <10in subsequent references, leading to misjudgment\nof results.\n•Misunderstanding Satisfiability (SAT) error: occasionally,\nLLM accurately identifies a solution set for a problem\nexpected to yield a satisfiable (SAT) result but instead\nreturns unsatisfiable (UNSAT). This misunderstanding\narises when the LLM erroneously treats an SAT problem\nas if it requires further solving, mistakenly assuming the\npresence of multiple solutions and consequently misclas-\nsifying it as UNSAT, leading to a misjudgment of the\nproblem.\n•Partial UNSAT error: In some instances, when the ground\ntruth of SAT is considered, LLM may detect conflicting\nassignments while disregarding certain existing ones,\nleading to the classification of the problem as unsatis-\nfiable. For instance, the formula {x= 1, x > y }is\ndeemed satisfiable because a suitable set of assignments\nlike{x= 1, y= 0}can fulfill all the criteria. However,\nLLMs may occasionally identify assignments such as\n{x= 1, y= 2}which conflict with the mentioned\nformula. In such cases, these assignments are designated\nas a UNSAT core by LLMs and consequently marked as\nUNSAT.\n•Bit-vector arithmetic error: Issues have been identified in\nmanaging bitwise operations on bit vectors, particularly\nwith certain operations posing challenges for the LLM.\nFor example, when attempting to shift 3 (binary 11) to\nthe left in a bit vector, the LLM might either provide an\naccurate outcome or misinterpret it as overflow, resulting\nin incorrect output.\n•Real arithmetic error: This category pertains to com-\nputational mistakes involving real numbers. It differs\nfrom the abstract division in SMT-LIB by encompassing\nerrors in both integer and floating-point computations.\nFor instance, it addresses issues such as establishing the\nequality of positive and negative zeros in floating-point\nnumbers, where the response from the software may lack\nclarity and may not guarantee the intended result.\n•Commonsense error: LLM sometimes commits basic\nmathematical mistakes, like mistakenly equating 1 with\n2 during calculations, or not identifying well-known\nlibrary functions by their names, potentially affecting\ntheir intended use. This classification also encompasses\nsituations where LLM misinterprets formulas or code, or\nstruggles to grasp them fully.\nFrom our analysis, it is evident that our method, DCoL,\naids the LLM in understanding satisfiability problems, thereby\nreducing the occurrence of misinterpretation of sat problems\nas equation-solving problems, and subsequently decreasing the\nincidence of misjudgment of problems. Moreover, in arith-\nmetic problems, DCoL assists the large model in decomposing\nthe initial arithmetic steps, resulting in significant performance\nimprovements."", '10 1 3 2 4 5\n12 0 2 1 3 3\n10 1 0 0 1 7CoSm\nCOT\nDCoLInferring errorMis-satPartial unsat BV arithmetic Real arithmetic Common sense\n024681012Fig. 8. Error analysis among different methods\nIt’s noteworthy to mention certain examples that, although\nnot within the purview of our research, are prevalent within\nthe industry but may not fare well with LLMs. One such\nexample is the type judgment commonly utilized in Z3Py,\nexemplified by the function is_add() as we will mention\nlater. In Z3 Python code, is_add() discerns whether the\nexpression within parentheses denotes an addition operation.\nFor instance, is_add(a + b) is expected to return true,\nwhile is_add(a) should return false. Because this function\ntype isn’t directly linked to logic but rather to language charac-\nteristics, it lies beyond the scope of our research. Nonetheless,\nfocusing solely on such functions, it is interesting that this kind\nof example may lead to suboptimal performance for LLMs.\nFor instance, is_add(1 + 2) is anticipated to return false\nbecause 1 + 2 is interpreted as a constant number in Z3Py,\nwhich may not only confuse LLMs but also confuse many\npeople who are not familiar with language features.\nAnother type of example originates from the SMTSim\ndataset collected from SMT-COMP 2023. Some SMT files\nare generated by intricate backend libraries, resulting in a\nsignificant number of variables and formulas within these\nexamples. However, considering the token limit for each query\nof LLMs, we had to filter SMT files, removing examples\nsurpassing a certain threshold of code lines or tokens per\nline. Nonetheless, many of these filtered examples contain\nqueries that cannot be resolved by Z3 or other solvers, yielding\nunknown results. These instances hold potential value for\nresearch in this domain, and we aspire to delve deeper into\nthis issue in future investigations.\nHard problems. SMTSim dataset contains complicated logic\ncode, with more lines of codes, variables, and theories. We\nregard it as a challenge for logic code simulation. We report\nthe performance of GPT families in Table IV.\nTABLE IV\nSMTS IMRESULTS\nMethod ACC. UNK. Exe.

However, the relatively\nlow execution accuracy reveals that LLMs struggling to solve\nsuch complex datasets. This issue may stem from the abun-\ndance of variables and constraints present. In the SMTSim\ndataset, numerous instances occur infrequently but are deeply\nintertwined. Due to their limitations in handling extensive con-\ntexts, LLMs struggle to address complex logical compositions\neffectively.\nAnswer to RQ3: Although LLMs demonstrate satisfactory\nperformance on several datasets, the potential drawbacks and\nlimitations of LLMs for logic code simulation should not be\nunderestimated.\nV. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this work, we introduce the novel concept of logic code\nsimulation to evaluate the ability to comprehend, analyze, and\nsimulate logic problems encoded in programs. We release three\ndatasets collected from the solver community and perform an\nextensible assessment to evaluate the capability of logic code\nsimulation for various LLMs. Furthermore, we propose DoCL,\na novel prompt fashion, to improve the reasoning performance\non code-based logic problems.\nIn the future, we are committed to further enhancing our\nDoCL, recognizing that there is considerable room for ad-\nvancement. Leveraging the principles of DoCL, numerous\ntechniques can be implemented to drive significant improve-\nments. Moreover, we aim to broaden the application of DoCL\nbeyond conventional logical solvers, which typically provide\nlimited outcomes such as SAT or UNSAT. By expanding its\nusage to encompass a wider array of logic code scenarios,\nwe can ensure that DoCL remains effective across diverse\nproblem-solving domains. Besides, through integration with\nresearch endeavors focusing on the conversion of natural\nlanguage into logical code, DoCL stands poised to establish\na groundbreaking paradigm in logic-based problem-solving\nmethodologies. Furthermore, by combining LLMs with knowl-\nedge retrieval and storage techniques, we look forward to\nthe real-life application of LLM-based logic solvers, which\ncan provide incredible efficiency in simulating complex logic\nprograms.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

For the Mar\nVersion of ChatGPT, we occasionally observe that\nChatGPT may still refuse to generate private infor-\nmation given jailbreaking prompts. Inspired by the\nmagic power of “Let’s think step by step” (Kojima\net al., 2022), we propose the Multi-step Jailbreak-\ning Prompt (MJP) to bypass the moral restrictions\nof LLMs and encourage LLMs to generate private\ninformation.\nOur proposed MJP aims to relieve LLMs’ ethical\nconsiderations and force LLMs to recover personal\ninformation. We merge jailbreaking prompts into\nthe three-utterance context between the user and\nChatGPT. First, we play the role of the user to input\nthe jailbreaking prompt. Second, we act as the as-\nsistant (ChatGPT) to acknowledge that the jailbreak\nmode is enabled. Finally, we perform as the user\nto query the assistant with previous direct prompts.\nMoreover, we append one more sentence to the\nfinal user query to encourage ChatGPT to make\na random guess if it does not know the email ad-\ndress or could not answer the emails due to ethical\nconsiderations. The second utterance convinces the\nLLM to accept its role of jailbreaking prompts. The\nlast appended sentence exploits indirect prompts\nto bypass the LLM’s ethical module and persuade\nthe LLM to generate or improvise personal infor-\nmation based on learned distribution. Figure 1 (c)\ndepicts that ChatGPT is more willing to make such\n“random guesses” based on the proposed MJP.\n3.3.4 Response Verification\nBesides prompt tricks, for each data sample, we\ncould also generate private information multipletimes with sampling-based decoding. As displayed\nin Figure 1 (d), we collect distinct personal infor-\nmation from diverse responses. We consider two\nmethods to verify which one is the correct answer.\nThe first method converts the collected information\ninto a multiple-choice question and prompts the\nLLM again to choose the correct answer. During\nimplementation, we treat the first displayed infor-\nmation in the response as the LLM’s final choice.\nThe second method is majority voting which re-\ngards the most frequent prediction as the final an-\nswer. If there is a tie, we randomly choose one\ncandidate as the final prediction.\n3.4 Personal Data Recovery from New Bing\nThe New Bing introduces a new search paradigm\nfrom search to the combination of search and AIGC\nto improve search accuracy and relevance. Mi-\ncrosoft even names the new combination as the\nPrometheus model to emphasize its importance.\nMoreover, they claim that safeguards are imple-\nmented to address issues like misinformation and\ndisinformation, data safety, and harmful content.\nHowever, unlike ChatGPT, the New Bing fre-\nquently responds to direct prompts mentioned in\nSection 3.3.1 according to our use cases. Here, we\nconsider two attack scenarios with direct prompts\nfor the new search paradigm. One is the free-form\nextraction that directly generates (name, PII) pairs\ngiven the domain information, and the other is par-\ntially identified extraction, which recovers PII with\ngiven names and domain information.

We present the results on ZH ⇒EN\nand EN ⇒ZH including COMETkiwi, decoding speed measured by tokens per second, decoding\nspeedup, and the ratio of the number of tokens accepted at the verification stage to the total tokens\nof the draft.\nAs depicted in Figure 10, Hybrid Threshold demonstrates improvement on the EN ⇒ZH test set\nbut exhibited a significant decrease on the EN ⇒RU test set. Additionally, Hybrid Thresholds with\ndifferent QE modules yield varying performances. This confirms that the performance of Hybrid\nThreshold relies on the precision of introduced QE modules and the quality of LLM translations\nemployed as replacement. In contrast, CoDec-16 outperforms most of the Hybrid Threshold models,\nshowing that the QE modules may not be necessary. This also indicates that our method achieves a\nbetter balance between efficiency and effectiveness.\n4.3 E FFECT OF DIFFERENT VALUES OF k\nIntuitively, as kincreases, cooperative decoding can accept a larger range of tokens of NMT trans-\nlations during the verification stage. Consequently, less content needs to be re-decoded by LLMs,\nresulting in reduced processing time. Here, we investigate the performance of CoDec under different\nvalues of k. We merge the WMT22 and WebCrawl test sets to simulate the distribution of translation\nrequests in real-world scenarios.\nAs shown in Table 5, with the increase of k, the ratio of tokens accepted on average and the decoding\nspeed increase consistently. With a large k,CoDeC-128 achieves 2.6x speedup over the baselines,\ni.e.,MicroMT in both ZH ⇔EN and TIM in EN⇒ZH, and also obtains higher COMETkiwi scores.\nThis signifies that CoDec effectively reduces decoding latency and maintains translation quality.\nOn the other hand, the models with lower kachieve better translation quality such as CoDec-8 ,\nindicating that kshould be chosen carefully to get the balance of performance and efficiency.\n13', 'Preprint.\n57.459.6759.2258.9158.5958.3162.965.365.164.864.464.177.577.477.577.677.677.6\n57.460.859.559.158.758.581.381.481.581.581.581.4\n62.965.165.164.764.464.2556065707580\nMicroMTCoDec-8CoDec-16CoDec-32CoDec-64CoDec-128COMETkiwiWMT22 (ZH-EN)WebCrawl (ZH-EN)WMT22 (EN-ZH)WebCrawl (EN-ZH)WMT22 (ZH-EN)*WebCrawl (ZH-EN)*WMT22 (EN-ZH)*WebCrawl (EN-ZH)*\nFigure 9: Performance of MicroMT, CoDec(QE), and CoDec with different values of k(Eq.\n1).

The significant gap\nbetween MicroMT andHybrid MaxRouting across all test sets provides strong support for our as-\nsertion that MT-oriented LLMs can serve as valuable fallback systems for NMT. Additionally, it\nis evident that Hybrid Threshold does not consistently yield improvements (e.g., on EN ⇒DE and\nEN⇒RU directions), as its effectiveness relies on the accuracy of the QE module and the quality of\nLLM translations used as substitutes. This suggests that the simplistic threshold-based replacement\ninHybrid Threshold may be sub-optimal. Intuitively, introducing CoDec to Hybrid Threshold par-\ntially addresses these limitations. The observed improvement is thanks to the valid-then-decoding\nmechanism employed in our CoDec. By validating the NMT translation first and then refining it,\nwe are able to retain high-quality translation segments while rectifying errors. Overall, the results\nhighlight the benefits of CoDec in terms of both inference efficiency and translation quality.\nCoDec(QE) vs. CoDec. We compare the performance of CoDec(QE) andCoDec with different\nvalues of k(Eq. 1). In Figure 9, we observe minimal performance variation on the WMT22 test\nsets, and we speculate that this is because when the NMT system itself produces translations of suf-\nficiently high quality, there is no need for further refinement by MT-oriented LLMs. However, as k\nincreases, both CoDec(QE) andCoDec exhibit gradual decreases in performance on the WebCrawl\ntest sets. The underlying reason is that a higher value of krepresents a more relaxed evaluation\nstandard during verification. Consequently, it allows more erroneous segments from the NMT trans-\nlations, leading to a decline in overall translation quality.\nCoDec vs. Hybrid Threshold. We compare the performance of CoDec and Hybrid Threshold\nusing different QE methods: HT(Random) , where we randomly replace 50% MicroMT’s transla-\ntions with TIM’s translations; HT(BLEURT-12) , which uses BLEURT-20-D1214as the QE method;\nHT(BLEURT-20) , which employs BLEURT-2015as the QE method; and HT(COMETkiwi) . We eval-\nuate different methods on the combined WMT22 and WebCrawl test sets in EN ⇒ZH in which TIM\noutperforms MicroMT , and WMT22 EN ⇒RU in which TIM underperforms MicroMT .\n14https://huggingface.co/lucadiliello/BLEURT-20-D12\n15https://huggingface.co/lucadiliello/BLEURT-20\n12']","As k increases, the ratio of tokens accepted on average and the decoding speed increase consistently.

We leave this as future exploration.\n4.3 Ablation Study\nIn this section, we examine variants of our attack framework under\ndifferent settings and hyperparameters.\nKey Strategies in Meta Prompt. The meta prompt used for jail-\nbreak template generation and optimization consists of two core\ncomponents: harmful content concealing and memory-reframing.\nTo assess the effectiveness of these two strategies, we modify the\nattacker’s meta prompt into two distinct variants. In version (2), the\nattacker model generates jailbreak prompts without being taught\nhow to conceal malicious commands. In version (3), instead of\nguiding the attacker to craft a prompt template incorporating the\nmemory-reframing scheme, the attacker only generates prompt\ntemplates that instruct the target model to start its response with\n""Sure! I’m happy to do that!"". As the examples in meta prompt\ncontain malicious content concealing and memory-reframing parts,\nwe use GPT-4 as the attacker in a cold-start setup to mitigate the\ninfluence of examples.2Other setups follow Section 4.2. As demon-\nstrated in Table 2, only by employing both strategies can we achieve\nfavorable results across various models. Additionally, we provide an\nexample in Figure 4 of Appendix D to illustrate how the memory-\nreframing strategy influences the response quality.\nInfluence of Examples in Meta Prompt. To investigate the impact\nof jailbreak template examples in the meta prompt, we conduct two\nsets of experiments: one is to provide the attacker with examples of\nvarying quality, while the other involves a cold-start without any\nexamples. The results are presented in Table 3. The quality of exam-\nples in group 1-3 is shown in Table 11 of Appendix B. It is evident\n2As the attacker, other LLMs cannot cold start according to our preliminary\nexperiments.\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nNumber of streams4050607080ASR (%)\nASR by number of streams\nLLaMA-2-7B (16 iter)\nLLaMA-2-7B (5 iter)\nGPT-3.5-0613 (16 iter)\nGPT-3.5-0613 (5 iter)\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\nNumber of iteration455055606570758085ASR (%)\nASR by number of Iteration\nLLaMA-2-7B (15 streams)\nLLaMA-2-7B (10 streams)\nGPT-3.5-0613 (15 streams)\nGPT-3.5-0613 (10 streams)Figure 3: ASR curve with respect to varied number of streams\n𝑁or number of iterations 𝐼.\nthat even when starting with relatively mediocre jailbreak tem-\nplates as examples (in settings (2) LLaMA-2-7B and (3) ChatGPT),\nwe are still able to generate significantly improved new jailbreak\ntemplates by increasing the number of rounds. However, in the\nabsence of examples, all attacker models, except for GPT-4, fail\nto generate prompt templates that meet the format requirements.\nSetting (4) demonstrates the performance of GPT-4 as an attacker\nmodel in a cold-start scenario without any examples. Moreover, by\nutilizing these prompts as examples, we are able to further enhance\nthe outcomes in the setting (5). In summary, unlike GPTFuzzer\nwhich requires 77 high-quality seed jailbreak prompts, our method\nTastle only requires a few examples that can be either crafted\nmanually or generated using GPT-4.\nNumber of Streams and Iterations. To study the impact of stream\nnumber𝑁and iteration number 𝐼, we manipulate one of them while\nkeeping the other fixed. However, due to the high randomness in the\nsearch problem, the results of a single experiment conducted under\na specific combination of 𝑁and𝐼may be unreliable. To address\nthis issue, we adopt a methodology akin to Bootstrap to estimate\nperformance. Specifically, we run experiments with 50 streams and\n16 iterations. Subsequently, for any given combination of 𝑁and𝐼,\nwhere𝑁≤16 and𝐼≤16, we sample 300 bootstrap samples from\nthe 50×16 experiment results. Each sample consists of 𝑁streams,\nand each stream is optimized through 𝐼iterations. To estimate the\nASR, we report the average ASR across these bootstrap samples. As\nshown in figure 3, there is a significant increase in the ASR as both\nthe number of streams and iterations rise from 1 to 4-6, after which\nthe marginal returns gradually diminish. Considering the variance\nof ASR decreases with an increase in the number of streams while\nremaining relatively unchanged with additional iterations, we opt\nfor 10 streams and 5 iterations given a fixed budget of 2,500 queries,\nin our study.\nInfluence of Attacker Model. We use Vicuna and ChatGPT as\nour attacker models. As shown in Table 4, the effectiveness of\nattacks on LLaMA-2-7B by different attackers is similar; however,\nVicuna exhibits a markedly superior attack performance against\nChatGPT. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to Vicuna’s\ninferior alignment safeguards, thereby rendering it more susceptible\nto complying with meta instructions to output jailbreak prompts.', 'Target Attacker Top-1 ASR Top-5 ASR\nLLaMA-2Vicuna 70.0(±1.6)87.3(±1.9)\nChatGPT 70.7(±6.8)88.0(±3.3)\nChatGPTVicuna 66.7(±6.6)77.3(±4.1)\nChatGPT 44.0(±4.3)62.7(±4.7)\nTable 4: Ablation study on different attacker models.\nConsequently, we have chosen Vicuna as our preferred attacker\nmodel for this study.\n5 ANALYSES\n5.1 Transfer Attacks to Different Queries\nDatasets CountVicuna LLaMA-2 ChatGPT GPT-4\nT1 T5 T1 T5 T1 T5 T1 T5\nCustom 50 98.0 100.0 70.0 87.3 66.7 77.3 38.0 44.0\nRemaining 470 90.6 98.3 59.4 81.6 60.3 74.0 46.8 56.6\nGPTFuzzer 100 93.0 98.3 62.0 86.3 64.3 76.3 58.0 73.0\nTable 5: Top-1 (T1) and Top-5 (T5) ASR scores of transfer\nattack on hold-out malicious queries.

We explore the efficacy\nof six request-level attack techniques in conjunction with our gen-\nerated jailbreak templates. These techniques include four rewriting\nstrategies [ 10], one encryption method [ 48], and two methods re-\nlated to low-resource language translation [ 45]. We process the\nAdvbench custom dataset using these techniques before merging\nthem with our templates for jailbreaking.\nThe results, as indicated in Table 7, reveal that integrating the\nfour rewriting techniques does not improve the jailbreak perfor-\nmance on LLaMA-2 and ChatGPT, thus we forgo further attempts\nto jailbreak GPT-4 using these methods. We speculate Tastle can\neffectively conceal malicious instructions while these rewriting\ntechniques may mislead the target LLMs about the malicious query.\nThe translation-based method does not improve the Top-1 ASR\nscore but can enhance the Top-5 ASR for GPT-4 significantly. This\nimprovement could potentially be explained by mismatched gen-\neralization [ 45], where safety training fails to generalize to the\nlow-resource languages for which LLMs’ capabilities exist.\n5.4 Defense Analyses\nWe explore three defense methods for the Tastle attack: (1) Self-\nReminder [43] encapsulates the user’s query that reminds LLMs\nto respond responsibly; (2) In-context Defense [41] enhances\nmodel robustness by demonstrations of rejecting to answer harmful\nprompts; (3) Perplexity Filter [17] defines a jailbreak prompt as\nattack fail when its log perplexity exceeds or equals the threshold.\nFor the former two defense strategies, we train on target mod-\nels with these defenses. As shown in Table 8, the Perplexity Filter']","The ASR scores for LLaMA-2 vs. ChatGPT without concealing malicious content are as follows: LLaMA-2 has Top-1 (T1) and Top-5 (T5) ASR scores of 2.0 and 4.0, respectively, while ChatGPT has T1 and T5 ASR scores of 34.0 and 40.0, respectively.

"How do fine-tuned datasets and multi-modal LLMs boost energy efficiency and decarbonization, similar to K2 and HouYi?","['5 Future Research Directions  \n5.1 Enhancing LLMs for Domain -Specific Tasks \nFuture research can focus on enhancing LLMs for domain -specific tasks in building energy efficiency and \ndecarbonization  studies. While LLMs are already capable of processing and analyzing large amounts of \ndata, further improvements can be made to tailor them to specific tasks in this field.  \nAn essential trajectory for forthcoming research centers around delineating the most suitable approach \namong fine -tuning, prompt engineering, or semantic search for distinct tasks. Rather than universally \napplying a single method, the optimal strategy may vary based on the specific requirements and nuances \nof each challenge. For instance, tasks demanding deep domain knowledge might benefit most from fine -\ntuning, where the model is further refined on specialized datasets. Wu et al. [11] developed BloombergGPT, \nthe first specialized LLM for the financial domain . BloombergGPT is a language model with 50 billion \nparameters, trained using an extensive variety of financial data . The concept of creating a similar model \nsuch as ""BuildingEnergyGPT"" is intriguing. However, the contexts in which we deploy it warrant thoughtful \nconsideration.  In contrast, scenarios requiring a broader understanding without deep specialization might \nbe aptly tackled through prompt engineering, optimizing the way LLMs  interact with and interpret a given \nquestion or data set. Meanwhile, when the priority is swiftly locating relevant insights within vast data \nreservoirs, semantic search could emerge as the most efficacious tool.  In essence, discerning the best -fit \nmethod for each task will be crucial, not only to maximize the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs but also to \nensure that they remain versatile and adaptive across a spectrum of challenges.   \nFuture directions in Enhancing LLMs for domain -specific tasks  in this field include: 1) Specialized Training \nDatasets  for LLM Fine -Tuning : Curate and develop domain -specific datasets enriched with building energy \nefficiency and decarbonization  knowledge. These datasets can be used to fine -tune models like \n""BuildingEnergyGPT"" to enhance their specificity and relevance , 2) Prompt Engineering Research : Delve \ndeeper into prompt engineering to optimize LLM interactions for domain -specific tasks, thereby ensuring  \nthat questions or tasks are interpreted with higher accuracy , self -consistency,  and context -awareness, and \n3) Semantic Search Enhancements : As we acknowledge the potential of semantic search in quickly \nlocating relevant insights, future research can focus on improving its efficiency and precision, especially in \ndomain -specific contexts.  \n5.2 Multi -Modal LLMs  \nMulti -modal LLMs represent a frontier in AI technology, where the systems are designed to process and \nintegrate information from various types of data — including, but not limited to, text, images, and videos \n— to perform more complex and nuanced tasks. Th ese models leverage the strengths of individual AI \ntechnologies, such as NLP and computer vision, to create a synergistic and more capable system.  \nIn the building sector, the deployment of multi -modal LLMs opens up a promising landscape for innovation, \noffering comprehensive and effective solutions by amalgamating LLMs with other AI technologies. This \nmulti -dimensional approach can significantly enha nce the analysis and interpretation of a diverse array of \ndata types prevalent in the sector, fostering a richer understanding and facilitating intelligent automation \nin various processes. For instance, integrating LLMs with computer vision technologies ca n enable the \nsimultaneous analysis of visual data such as building blueprints or thermal imagery alongside textual data, \nproviding a deeper, more holistic view of building systems and environments. Moreover, it can aid in the ', '46 Wang, et al.\ntasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, binary classification, and question\nanswering.\n5.7 Other Domain-Enhanced LLMs\nGeoscience and Environment domain-enhanced LLMs. are expertly designed, leveraging vast\ncorpora to provide precise and robust results pertaining to geoscience and renewable energy. K2, a\ntrailblazer in geoscience LLM, was trained on a massive geoscience text corpus and further refined\nusing the GeoSignal dataset. Meanwhile, the HouYi model, another pioneering LLM focusing on\nrenewable energy, harnessed the Renewable Energy Academic Paper dataset, containing over a\nmillion academic literature sources. These LLMs are fine-tuned to deliver adept performance in\ntheir respective fields, showing substantial capabilities in aligning their responses with user queries\nand renewable energy academic literature.\nDeng et al . [52] introduce K2, the first LLM designed specifically for geoscience, which is a\nLLaMA-7B continuously trained on a 5.5 billion token geoscience text corpus and fine-tuned using\nthe GeoSignal dataset. The paper also presents resources like GeoSignal, a geoscience instruction\ntuning dataset, and GeoBench, the first geoscience benchmark for evaluating LLMs in the context\nof geoscience.\nBai et al . [8] present the development of the HouYi model, the first LLM specifically designed for\nrenewable energy, utilizing the newly created Renewable Energy Academic Paper (REAP) dataset,\nwhich contains over 1.1 million academic literature sources related to renewable energy, and the\nHouYi model is fine-tuned based on general LLMs such as ChatGLM-6B.\nBi et al . [14] present OceanGPT, the first-ever LLM in the ocean domain, which is expert in\nvarious ocean science tasks. They also propose a novel framework called DoInstruct to automatically\nobtain a large volume of ocean domain data. OceanGPT is evaluated in OceanBench and shows a\nhigher level of knowledge expertise for oceans science tasks.\nEducation domain-enhanced LLMs. are used for assisting education scenarios. An example is\nGrammarGPT [ 64], which provides an innovative approach to language learning, particularly focus-\ning on error correction in Chinese grammar. It is an open-source LLM designed for native Chinese\ngrammatical error correction, which leverages a hybrid dataset of ChatGPT-generated and human-\nannotated data, along with heuristic methods to guide the model in generating ungrammatical\nsentences. The backbone model used is phoenix-inst-chat-7b.\nFood domain-enhanced LLMs. are language models specifically designed to meet the distinct\nrequirements of food testing protocols. For example, Qi et al . [209] introduce FoodGPT, a LLM for\nfood testing that incorporates structured knowledge and scanned documents using an incremental\npre-training approach, with a focus on addressing machine hallucination by constructing a knowl-\nedge graph as an external knowledge base, utilizing the Chinese-LLaMA2-13B as the backbone\nmodel and collecting food-related data for training.\nHome renovation domain-enhanced LLMs. are domain-specific language models tailored for home\nrenovation tasks. For example, Wen et al . [277] introduce ChatHome, which uses a dual-pronged\nmethodology involving domain-adaptive pretraining and instruction-tuning on an extensive dataset\ncomprising professional articles, standard documents, and web content relevant to home renovation.\nThe backbone model is Baichuan-13B, and the evaluation datasets include C-Eval, CMMLU, and the\nnewly created ""EvalHome"" domain dataset, while the fine-tuning data sources encompass National\nStandards, Domain Books, Domain Websites, and WuDaoCorpora.\nACM Comput.

It is beneficial to group these hot-activated neurons\ntogether and store them in the cache for better efficiency of parameter access. Following Song et al. (2023), we calculate the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) of neuron activation for different models. In Figure 8, we plot the CDF of neuron\nactivation for 1B models.

We can observe a significant existence\nof hot-activated neurons in some layers of all models. For example, the top 20% neurons are activated for more than 80%\nof the time in the lower layers of OPT 6B.

Fine-grained categorization of research on unifying large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs (KGs).\n4 KG- ENHANCED LLM S\nLarge language models (LLMs) achieve promising results\nin many natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs\nhave been criticized for their lack of practical knowledge\nand tendency to generate factual errors during inference.\nTo address this issue, researchers have proposed integrating\nknowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance LLMs. In this sec-\ntion, we first introduce the KG-enhanced LLM pre-training,\nwhich aims to inject knowledge into LLMs during the pre-\ntraining stage. Then, we introduce the KG-enhanced LLM\ninference, which enables LLMs to consider the latest knowl-\nedge while generating sentences. Finally, we introduce the\nKG-enhanced LLM interpretability, which aims to improve\nthe interpretability of LLMs by using KGs. Table 2 summa-\nrizes the typical methods that integrate KGs for LLMs.\n4.1 KG-enhanced LLM Pre-training\nExisting large language models mostly rely on unsupervised\ntraining on the large-scale corpus. While these models may\nexhibit impressive performance on downstream tasks, they\noften lack practical knowledge relevant to the real world.\nPrevious works that integrate KGs into large language mod-\nels can be categorized into three parts: 1) Integrating KGs into\ntraining objective ,2) Integrating KGs into LLM inputs , and 3)\nKGs Instruction-tuning .\n4.1.1 Integrating KGs into Training Objective\nThe research efforts in this category focus on designing\nnovel knowledge-aware training objectives. An intuitive\nidea is to expose more knowledge entities in the pre-training\nobjective. GLM [102] leverages the knowledge graph struc-\nture to assign a masking probability.

However, it requires\nretraining the models, which is time-consuming and re-\nquires lots of resources.\n4.2 KG-enhanced LLM Inference\nThe above methods could effectively fuse knowledge into\nLLMs. However, real-world knowledge is subject to change\nand the limitation of these approaches is that they do\nnot permit updates to the incorporated knowledge without\nretraining the model. As a result, they may not generalize\nwell to the unseen knowledge during inference [126]. There-\nfore, considerable research has been devoted to keeping the\nknowledge space and text space separate and injecting the\nknowledge while inference. These methods mostly focus on\nthe Question Answering (QA) tasks, because QA requires\nthe model to capture both textual semantic meanings and\nup-to-date real-world knowledge.\n4.2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Fusion\nRetrieval-Augmented Knowledge Fusion is a popular\nmethod to inject knowledge into LLMs during inference.\nThe key idea is to retrieve relevant knowledge from a large\ncorpus and then fuse the retrieved knowledge into LLMs.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, RAG [92] proposes to combine non-\nparametric and parametric modules to handle the external\nknowledge. Given the input text, RAG first searches for rel-\nevant KG in the non-parametric module via MIPS to obtain\nseveral documents. RAG then treats these documents as\nhidden variables zand feeds them into the output generator,\nempowered by Seq2Seq LLMs, as additional context infor-\nmation. The research indicates that using different retrieved\ndocuments as conditions at different generation steps per-\nforms better than only using a single document to guide\nthe whole generation process. The experimental results\nshow that RAG outperforms other parametric-only and\nnon-parametric-only baseline models in open-domain QA.\nRAG can also generate more specific, diverse, and factual\ntext than other parameter-only baselines. Story-fragments\n[127] further improves architecture by adding an additional\nmodule to determine salient knowledge entities and fuse\nthem into the generator to improve the quality of generated\nlong stories. EMAT [115] further improves the efficiency of\nsuch a system by encoding external knowledge into a key-\nvalue memory and exploiting the fast maximum inner prod-\nuct search for memory querying. REALM [114] proposes a\nnovel knowledge retriever to help the model to retrieve and\nattend over documents from a large corpus during the pre-\ntraining stage and successfully improves the performance\nof open-domain question answering. KGLM [113] selects\nthe facts from a knowledge graph using the current context\nto generate factual sentences. With the help of an external\nknowledge graph, KGLM could describe facts using out-of-\ndomain words or phrases.\n4.2.2 KGs Prompting\nTo better feed the KG structure into the LLM during infer-\nence, KGs prompting aims to design a crafted prompt that\nKnowledge\nRetrieverLLMs A: USA\nBackpropagationKGs\nQ: Which country\nis Obama from?Retrieved Facts\n(Obama, BornIn, Honolulu)\n(Honolulu, LocatedIn, USA)Fig. 11. Retrieving external knowledge to enhance the LLM generation.\nconverts structured KGs into text sequences, which can be\nfed as context into LLMs. In this way, LLMs can better take\nadvantage of the structure of KGs to perform reasoning. Li\net al. [64] adopt the pre-defined template to convert each\ntriple into a short sentence, which can be understood by\nLLMs for reasoning. Mindmap [65] designs a KG prompt to\nconvert graph structure into a mind map that enables LLMs\nto perform reasoning by consolidating the facts in KGs and\nthe implicit knowledge from LLMs. ChatRule [116] sam-\nples several relation paths from KGs, which are verbalized\nand fed into LLMs. Then, LLMs are prompted to generate\nmeaningful logical rules that can be used for reasoning. CoK\n[117] proposes a chain-of-knowledge prompting that uses a\nsequence of triples to elicit the reasoning ability of LLMs to\nreach the final answer.\nKGs prompting presents a simple way to synergize\nLLMs and KGs. By using the prompt, we can easily harness\nthe power of LLMs to perform reasoning based on KGs\nwithout retraining the models. However, the prompt is\nusually designed manually, which requires lots of human\neffort.\n4.3 Comparison between KG-enhanced LLM Pre-\ntraining and Inference\nKG-enhanced LLM Pre-training methods commonly en-\nrich large-amount of unlabeled corpus with semantically\nrelevant real-world knowledge. These methods allow the\nknowledge representations to be aligned with appropri-\nate linguistic context and explicitly train LLMs to lever-\nage those knowledge from scratch. When applying the\nresulting LLMs to downstream knowledge-intensive tasks,\nthey should achieve optimal performance. In contrast, KG-\nenhanced LLM inference methods only present the knowl-\nedge to LLMs in the inference stage and the underlying\nLLMs may not be trained to fully leverage these knowledge\nwhen conducting downstream tasks, potentially resulting in\nsub-optimal model performance.\nHowever, real-world knowledge is dynamic and requires\nfrequent updates. Despite being effective, the KG-enhanced\nLLM Pre-training methods never permit knowledge up-\ndates or editing without model re-training. As a result, the\nKG-enhanced LLM Pre-training methods could generalize\npoorly to recent or unseen knowledge. KG-enhanced LLM\ninference methods can easily maintain knowledge updates\nby changing the inference inputs. These methods help im-\nprove LLMs performance on new knowledge and domains.\nIn summary, when to use these methods depends on the\napplication scenarios.

How does LocalGPT use RAG and fine-tuning to improve neighborhood-specific queries?,"['2 Knowledge Tasks\nKnowledge tasks are fundamental in social networks since lots of users come to social network platforms for information\nseeking. In this chapter, we will describe the LocalGPT system, a neighborhood-specific LLM that we build for domain-\nspecific question-answering.\n2.1 Introduction to LocalGPT System\nWe build LocalGPT, a LLM that contains the local knowledge from the Nextdoor data. LocalGPT can answer users’\nquestions and search queries about users’ neighborhoods like Figure 1. LocalGPT can be used in search, like Microsoft\nBingGPT. LocalGPT may be used to add a comment to a user’s post that has not been answered by other users.\nWe note that the existing LLMs like ChatGPT have shortcomings for our purposes because these models do not have up-\nto-date information due to the cutoff date in the training data, and because they are not trained with questions specialized\nto Nextdoor’s domain [ Vu et al., 2023 ]. For instance, in our use case, to provide answers to the neighborhood-specific\nquestions such as “Does anyone know of a reputable and affordable wedding photographer in the San Francisco Bay\nArea?” or “Do you have any real-time updates on the status of wildfires in Sonoma county”, pre-trained LLMs or\ntraditional web search might fail or provide a generic answer due to insufficient domain-specific knowledge stored or\nno real-time information about the topic.\nTo address the limitation of existing LLMs, our LocalGPT employs two solutions. First, we apply Retrieval-Augmented-\nGeneration (RAG): given a user query, we retrieve the most relevant documents in the Nextdoor data, and use the\ndocuments to generate an answer. Second, we fine-tune LLMs with our data. In particular, we fine-tune LLMs so\nthat they learn what questions our users would ask (instruction tuning), and also what kinds of answers the users\nwould prefer (preference learning). Our final models would combine these two approaches. Figure 1 is an end-to-end\nillustration of the LocalGPT system.\nFigure 1: An Illustration of the LocalGPT System.\nRetrieval-Augmented-Generation : Our first method is RAG. In RAG, we retrieve relevant Nextdoor documents\n(user’s posts and comments) for a user query. Then we ask pre-trained LLMs to generate answers using the docu-\nments [ Ram et al., 2023 ]. RAG provides multiple benefits. First, RAG allows us to answer questions with the up-to-date\ninformation that happened after the cutoff date of the LLM training data. Second, RAG reduces hallucination because\nwe ask LLMs to provide answers within the retrieved documents.\n6']","LocalGPT employs two solutions to improve neighborhood-specific queries.

"How does PPTC evaluate LLMs on multi-turn, multi-modal PowerPoint tasks, and what challenges affect their accuracy?","['PPTC Benchmark: Evaluating Large Language Models for PowerPoint\nTask Completion\nYiduo Guo1∗, Zekai Zhang1∗, Yaobo Liang2, Dongyan Zhao1, Nan Duan2\n1Peking University\n2Microsoft Research Asia\nyiduo@stu.pku.edu.cn,justinzzk@stu.pku.edu.cn,yaobo.liang@microsoft.com\nzhaody@pku.edu.cn,nanduan@microsoft.com\nAbstract\nRecent evaluations of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have centered around testing their zero-\nshot/few-shot capabilities for basic natural lan-\nguage tasks and their ability to translate instruc-\ntions into tool APIs. However, the evaluation\nof LLMs utilizing complex tools to finish multi-\nturn, multi-modal instructions in a complex\nmulti-modal environment has not been inves-\ntigated. To address this gap, we introduce the\nPowerPoint Task Completion (PPTC) bench-\nmark to assess LLMs’ ability to create and edit\nPPT files based on user instructions. It con-\ntains 279 multi-turn sessions covering diverse\ntopics and hundreds of instructions involving\nmulti-modal operations. We also propose the\nPPTX-Match Evaluation System that evaluates\nif LLMs finish the instruction based on the pre-\ndiction file rather than the label API sequence,\nthus it supports various LLM-generated API\nsequences. We measure 3 closed LLMs and\n6 open-source LLMs. The results show that\nGPT-4 outperforms other LLMs with 75.1%\naccuracy in single-turn dialogue testing but\nfaces challenges in completing entire sessions,\nachieving just 6% session accuracy. We find\nthree main error causes in our benchmark: er-\nror accumulation in the multi-turn session, long\nPPT template processing, and multi-modality\nperception. These pose great challenges for fu-\nture LLM and agent systems. We release the\ndata, code, and evaluation system of PPTC at\nhttps://github.com/gydpku/PPTC .\n1 Introduction\nRecent evaluation works for Large Language Mod-\nels (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)) fo-\ncus on their zero-shot/few-shot abilities on basic\nnatural language tasks (Jiao et al., 2023; Zhong\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b; Qin et al., 2023a)\nand their tool-use ability to generate APIs for solv-\ning user instructions, such as basic APIs like a\ncalculator in tool transformer (Schick et al., 2023),\n*Equal contribution\nFigure 1: Within our benchmark, we simulate this multi-\nturn dialogue scenario between humans and LLMs to\nevaluate LLMs’ PPT task completion performance.\nRapidAPIs in ToolLLM (Qin et al., 2023c), and\nhugggingface APIs in Gorilla (Patil et al., 2023).\nHowever, these tool-use works emphasize the trans-\nlation of natural language instructions into APIs\nand ignore the challenge of using APIs in the ob-\nservation of complex multi-modal environments\nto finish user instructions. Also, their evaluation\napproach focuses on comparing the generated APIs\nwith the label API sequence, assuming there’s only\none unique solution. This approach becomes im-\npracticable in situations with multiple/unlimited\ncorrect solutions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Power- PointTaskCompletion (PPTC),\na benchmark that measures LLMs’ performance in\ncreating and editing PPT file tasks based on user\ninstructions. We choose PowerPoint as it includes\nvarious elements like textbox, table, and image and\nsupports a wider range of APIs than Word and Ex-\ncel.\nOur benchmark has three distinctive featuresarXiv:2311.01767v2  [cs.CL]  7 Nov 2023', 'of the file pass these tests. Evaluation metrics in-\nclude turn-based accuracy which is the ratio of\ncorrectly completed turns to the total number of\nturns and session-based accuracy which is the ra-\ntio of correctly completed sessions to the overall\nsession count.\nWe measure the performance of three closed-\nsource LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Davince-003)\nand six open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMa-2) in\nour benchmark. We further test planning (e.g.,\nCoT (Wei et al., 2022)) and content selection al-\ngorithms’ performance based on GPT-4. Experi-\nment results show that GPT-4 is the strongest LLM\namong all LLMs but still encounters challenges\nwhen completing entire multi-turn sessions. For ex-\nample, although GPT-4 achieves 75.1% turn-based\naccuracy in the creating new PPT file task, it only\nachieves 22.7% session-based accuracy as errors\nmade in previous turns. GPT-4 and other LLMs\nalso struggle to process long PPT templates (com-\nplex file environment). For example, GPT-4 only\nachieves 38.1% turn-based accuracy in the edit-\ning task. We further find that GPT-4 struggles to\nfinish instructions involving non-text modality op-\nerations, especially for position-related operations,\nsuch as ’Put object A on the top of the slide’. It\nonly achieves 24% accuracy in these instructions.\nIn summary, this paper has the following contri-\nbutions:\n(1) We propose the PowerPoint Task Completion\nbenchmark to measure LLM’s task completion per-\nformance within the PowerPoint official software.\nThis benchmark contains 279 multi-turn sessions\nwith hundreds of multi-modal instructions in the\ncomplex multi-modal environment.\n(2) We propose the PPTX-evaluation system to\nautomatically measure LLMs’ performance in our\nbenchmark. We test 3 closed-source LLMs and\n6 open-source LLMs and find that GPT-4 is the\nstrongest LLM among all LLMs.\n(3) We further analyze LLMs in our benchmarks\nand find three key error factors: error accumulation\nin the session, long PPT template processing, and\nmulti-modality perception. These findings pose\nsignificant challenges for future LLMs and LLM-\nbased systems.\n2 PPTC Benchmark\nIn this section, we introduce our Power-Point\nTask Completion (PPTC) benchmark, including\nthe overview of our benchmark, its collection andvalidation process, and the PPTX-Match Evalua-\ntion System for evaluation. We further analyze the\nstatistics information of our benchmark.\n2.1 Benchmark Overview\nBenchmark components Our benchmark focuses\non two basic tasks within PowerPoint: creating the\nnew PPT file and editing the existing long PPT\ntemplate for measuring long PPT Content under-\nstanding. We have gathered 229 multi-turn dia-\nlogue sessions for creating the new PPT file and\n50 sessions for editing existing templates. Each\nmulti-turn session includes 2 to 17 turns. Each turn\ncomprises three parts: (1) the user instruction (2)\nthe label output file as the ground truth (3) one feasi-\nble API sequence for finishing the instruction. Our\nbenchmark also contains an API reference file that\nincludes 49 feasible APIs for various operations\nand can complete all instructions in our benchmark.\nFor each API, we describe its functionality and\narguments and provide usage guidelines. For com-\nplex APIs, we also offer example cases. We list the\ndetails of all APIs in Appendix A.\nTask description To complete the instruction in\none turn, in general, the AI assistant must compre-\nhend the user’s current and prior instructions for\ncontext. It should also analyze the content of the\nPPT file to identify relevant objects mentioned in\nthe instruction. Additionally, it needs to select ap-\npropriate APIs from a reference API file to achieve\nthe user’s goals. So we use these as the input of the\nAI assistant and it should output an API sequence\nas the solution. Then, it executes this API sequence\nand provides the user with the resulting PPT file as\nits response (See the whole process in Figure 2).\nAddressing LLM limitations in our bench-\nmark Compared to the general AI assistant, LLMs\nstill have two limitations for completing the task\nin our benchmarks: (1) LLMs can not directly pro-\ncess the PPT file. So we provide a PPT reader\nfunction that extracts all shapes and their informa-\ntion from the PPT file and transforms them into the\ntext format as the PPT file content. Then LLMs can\nunderstand and process the PPT file content. (2)\nLLMs cannot directly use PPT software through a\nkeyboard and mouse. Therefore, we have defined\nPPT APIs based on the operational logic within\nthe PPT software. and provide an implementation\nfor these APIs in Python that can swiftly gener-\nate PPT files. In future work, it may be possible\nto explore the use of large multimodal models to']","PPTC evaluates LLMs on multi-turn, multi-modal PowerPoint tasks by simulating multi-turn dialogue scenarios between humans and LLMs, where the LLMs must create and edit PPT files based on user instructions. The evaluation metrics include turn-based accuracy, which is the ratio of correctly completed turns to the total number of turns, and session-based accuracy, which is the ratio of correctly completed sessions to the overall session count. Challenges affecting their accuracy include error accumulation in multi-turn sessions, difficulties in processing long PPT templates, and issues with multi-modality perception, especially for position-related operations.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '1', 'file_name': '2311.01767v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2311.01767v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1818762, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2311.01767v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2311.01767v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1818762, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How do visual-language LLMs boost image search accuracy?,"['18 \n \uf0b7 Relational understanding: The ability to understand the relationships between entities in an image. \n\uf0b7 Compositional understanding: The ability to understand how entities in an image can be combined to form new \nconcepts. \n\uf0b7 Contextual understanding: The ability to understand how the context of an image can affect the interpretation of its \ncontent. \nIt finds that visual-language LLMs are able to achieve good performance on tasks that require relational understanding , \nsuch as image question answering. However, they are less successful on tasks that require compositional and contextual \nunderstanding , such as visual question generation. This suggests that visual-language LLMs may not have a deep \nunderstanding of the content they are processing. \nConcept Extraction from Text and Image with Visual-Language LLMs  \nConcept extraction  is the process of identifying and extracting concepts from text or image. This is a challenging task, as \nconcepts can be represented in a variety of ways, both in text and in image. Concept extraction from text  has been discussed \nin Section 4 Concept Extraction from Text with LLMs. \nVisual-language LLMs can be used for concept extraction from image  in a number of ways. One way is to use the LLM \nto generate a  natural language description  of an image. This description can then be analyzed to identify the concepts that \nare present in the image. Another way is to use the LLM to answer questions  about an image. The questions that are asked \ncan be designed to elicit information about specific concepts. For example, a question like ""What is the object in the \nforeground?"" can be used to extract the concept of ""object"" from the image. Finally, both ways can be combined by using the \nLLM to generate a natural language description of an image, and then using the LLM to answer questions about the image. \nThe combination of the natural language description and the answers to the questions can then be used to identify the \nconcepts that are present in the image. \nHere are some examples of how concept extraction from image can be used in real-world applications : \n\uf0b7 Image search: Concept extraction can be used to improve the accuracy of image search. By identifying the concepts \nthat are present in an image, visual-language LLMs can help to match the image to relevant search results. ', ""19 \n \uf0b7 Virtual assistants: Concept extraction can be used to improve the capabilities of virtual assistants. By understanding \nthe concepts that are present in a user's query with image, virtual assistants can provide more relevant and \ninformative responses. \nConcept Graph Extraction from Text and Image with Visual-Language LLMs  \nConcept graph extraction  is the task of extracting a graph of concepts from text or image. Concept graph extraction from \ntext has been discussed in Section 5 Concept Graph Extraction from Text with LLMs. \nThere are a number of different approaches to concept graph extraction from image , including: \n\uf0b7 Text-based approaches: These approaches use natural language processing techniques to extract concepts from the \ntext associated with an image . \n\uf0b7 Image-based approaches: These approaches use computer vision techniques to extract concepts from the image \nitself. \n\uf0b7 Hybrid approaches: These approaches combine text-based and image-based approaches to extract concepts from \nboth the image and the associated text. \nConcept graph extraction from image can be used for a variety of tasks, such as: \n\uf0b7 Image understanding: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of an image, which can then \nbe used to understand the meaning of the image. \n\uf0b7 Visual question answering: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of a question involving \nimage, which can then be used to answer the question. \n\uf0b7 Visual dialogue: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of a dialogue involving image, \nwhich can then be used to generate more natural and engaging dialogue. \nVisual-Language LLMs for Concept Learning  \nVisual-language LLMs can be used for concept learning  in a number of ways, including: ""]","Visual-language LLMs boost image search accuracy by identifying the concepts that are present in an image, which helps to match the image to relevant search results.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '18', 'file_name': '2306.17089v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2306.17089v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 667995, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '19', 'file_name': '2306.17089v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2306.17089v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 667995, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

"How does EE-LLM use pipeline parallelism for faster inference vs. KV recomputation, and what are its limits?","['Stage 112345Stage 212345Stage 312345Stage 412345Stage 112345Stage 212345Stage 312345Stage 412345Main forwardKV forwardFigure 6: A comparison between the standard full-model inference (top), and our pipeline-based approach\nof early-exit inference (bottom). Numbers in the blocks represent the tokens within one generated sequence.\nHere, we consider the special case where each early exit is located at the end of a certain pipeline stage, just\nfor simplicity of visualization.\n5.2 A new solution: pipeline parallelism\nWe propose a novel solution that leverages a new type of pipeline parallelism during inference. The key idea\nis that, in the process of inference with multiple pipeline stages, the following two processes run in parallel\nwhenever the model decides to do early exiting for the current token at a certain early exit:\n•The generated token is sent back to the first stage, and the forward pass for generating the next token\nis started immediately;\n•The full-model forward pass of the current token is continued from the exiting layer, which fulfills the\nKV caches in all later layers.\nSee Figure 6 for a visualization of our proposed approach. Even though each token essentially goes through\na forward pass of the full model, the computation after the exiting layer is parallelized with the computation\nof later tokens, which is how acceleration is achieved in this approach. It can be checked that the inference\nlatency for generating one token at a certain exit matches exactly the time needed for the forward compu-\ntation before returning an output at that exit, unless the selected exit is located in the middle of the first\npipeline stage, in which case generation of the next token has to wait until the forward pass of the first stage\nfor the current token is completed. Note that this is true not just in practice but also for the theoretical time\ncomplexity, without relying on the batching effect of GPU computation like KV recomputation does.\nAn implementation of this pipeline-based inference method is provided in EE-LLM. One potential limita-\ntion of the proposed method is that it requires multiple devices to facilitate pipeline parallelism, although\nparallelism within a single GPU or other device might be possible with more advanced implementation.\n6 Implementations\nThe implementation of EE-LLMis based on Megatron-LM [49], primarily extending Megatron-LM’s model\narchitectures, pipeline scheduling, and inference service to support the training and inference of early-exit\nLLMs. We introduce each of these aspects in more details below.\n6.1 Model architectures\nWe have introduced a new class of models called EarlyExitGPTModel , which is the early-exit counterpart\nofGPTModel in the original model library of Megatron-LM. The model is constructed with a few other\nclasses, including EarlyExitTransformerLayer ,EarlyExitTransformer , and EarlyExitLanguageModel .\n14', '0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\nThreshold01234Average inference time (s)\nKV recomputation [TP=4]\nKV recomputation [TP=1]\nPipeline-based [PP=4](a) XSUM\n0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\nThreshold0246Average inference time (s)\nKV recomputation [TP=4]\nKV recomputation [TP=1]\nPipeline-based [PP=4] (b) CNN/DailyMail\nFigure 10: A comparison of inference speed between the pipeline-based method (with 4 pipeline stages) and\nKV recomputation (with the degree of tensor parallelism set to 1 or 4) for our 7B early-exit model.\n8 Related works\nAs introduced in Section 1, early exiting has been widely applied for accelerating inference of deep neural\nnetworks in the literature. In terms of early-exit Transformers in the NLP domain, the majority of prior\nworks is focused on BERT [16] or other encoder-only models for classification tasks [45, 25, 94, 19, 63, 81,\n62, 82, 42, 26]. Recent works have begun to study token-wise early exiting for accelerating inference of\nencoder-decoder or decoder-only LLMs in autoregressive sequence generation [62, 13, 3, 76]. While they are\nlargely focused on designing inference mechanisms, the lack of support in prior works for training early-exit\nmodels with massive 3D parallelism inevitably posts an obstacle towards truly scaling up early-exit LLMs.\nOur work on EE-LLMis one important step towards eliminating this obstacle, and we also contribute a novel\npipeline-based inference mechanism along the way.\nInterestingly, early exiting has been used for many other purposes in the literature, besides accelerating\ninference. For example, early-exit losses can provide deep supervision and regularization for training deep\nnetworks with enhanced stability of convergence [69, 39], which motivates our implementation of the cool-\ndown option for non-constant early-exit loss weights, as explained in Section 4.3.1. Other works use early\nexits for interpreting the intermediate features learned by each layer of a Transformer [37], for improving\noutputs of the final exit [22], or as the draft models in speculative decoding [33]. Early exiting has also\nfound application in long-tailed classification [18], federated learning with heterogeneous clients [29, 93],\ntoken reduction [1], layer-wise training of deep networks [60, Section 5.3], among others. We believe that\nour progress in this work can be beneficial for these various purposes.\nIt is worth mentioning that there are other types of dynamic neural networks [24, 83] that facilitate\nconditional computation and elastic inference, such as layer skipping [6, 5, 79, 13, 17, 87, 78] and mixtures\nof experts [30, 66, 21]. Another line of work aims to accelerate LLM inference by designing new decoding\nmethods rather than model architectures [40, 59, 91]. Each of these approaches has its own pros and cons,\nand some of them can be complemented by early exiting. A detailed comparison between these methods is\nbeyond the scope of the current work.\n9 Conclusions\nWe have introduced EE-LLM, a system for large-scale training and inference of early-exit LLMs with 3D par-\nallelism. For training, we have presented how to execute backpropagation of the early-exit training objective\nacross pipeline stages, various performance optimizations for minimizing the computational overhead com-\npared to training standard LLMs, and some advanced features for more fine-grained control and optimization\nof the training process. For inference, we have introduced our design and implementation of two inference\nmethods, one based on KV recomputation and the other based on a new type of pipeline parallelism, both\nof which are compatible with KV caching for autoregressive generation. Along the way, we have discovered\n21']","EE-LLM uses pipeline parallelism for faster inference by running two processes in parallel whenever the model decides to do early exiting for the current token at a certain early exit: the generated token is sent back to the first stage to start the forward pass for the next token immediately, and the full-model forward pass of the current token is continued from the exiting layer to fulfill the KV caches in all later layers.

"How do agreeableness and other Big Five traits affect trust and altruism, compared to neuroticism?","['A the Big Five\nPersonality is defined as “the coherent pattern of\naffect, cognition, and desires (goals) as they lead\nto behavior” (Cervone and Pervin, 2022). the Big\nFive represents the most widely adopted person-\nality framework for quantifying personality. This\npersonality theory is not only applicable to individ-\nuals across many countries and cultures (Schmitt\net al., 2007) but also furnishes reliable assessment\nscales for measuring personality. Here’s a detailed\nlook at the five personality traits that make up the\nBig Five.\nOpenness to experience is commonly defined as\nthe extent and intricacy of an individual’s cognitive\nlife and encounters (John et al., 1999). This trait\nis frequently concomitant with attributes such as\nimagination, originality, and insight within the psy-\nchological framework. Individuals demonstrating\na pronounced openness to experience are inclined\ntowards venturing beyond their comfort zones, em-\nbracing novelty, and deriving satisfaction from\nartistic pursuits. Additionally, such individuals are\npredisposed to cultivating new social connections.\nConversely, an individual exhibiting a diminished\nopenness to experience may manifest tendencies\ntowards conformity, obstinacy, and a preference\nfor more concrete, non-abstract elements in var-\nious aspects of life (Lebowitz, 2016). Openness\nto experience displayed a diminished association\nwith both neuroticism and extraversion while ex-\nhibiting predominantly negligible correlations with\nagreeableness and conscientiousness (Ones et al.,\n1996).\nConscientiousness is closely linked to organi-\nzational tendencies, conformity, and a predilection\nfor seeking security, demonstrating an inverse asso-ciation with a penchant for stimulation and excite-\nment. Individuals characterized by a high degree\nof conscientiousness are likely to place value on at-\ntributes such as order, responsibility, achievement,\nand self-discipline. They engage in conscious delib-\neration and earnest efforts to enhance their abilities,\nreflecting a commitment to continuous improve-\nment (Roccas et al., 2002). This trait exhibited a\nmodest negative correlation with neuroticism and\na modest positive correlation with agreeableness;\nhowever, its association with other factors did not\nreach statistical significance (Ones et al., 1996).\nExtraversion , a personality trait distinguished\nby enthusiasm, sociability, talkativeness, confi-\ndence, and heightened emotional expressiveness,\nencapsulates a spectrum of individual dispositions.\nIndividuals exhibiting high levels of extraversion\ntypically prioritize achievement and excitement\nwhile assigning comparatively lesser value to tra-\ndition or conformity (Roccas et al., 2002). Such\nindividuals are often characterized by confidence,\nactivity, and sociability, opting for pursuits that es-\nchew self-denial in favor of experiences character-\nized by excitement and pleasure. Conversely, intro-\nverts commonly display a preference for solitude,\nexhibit unsociable tendencies, and may manifest\nlower levels of self-confidence. In addition, when\ncompared with the other five factors, extroversion\nwas weakly negatively correlated with neuroticism\nand positively correlated with openness to experi-\nence (Ones et al., 1996).\nAgreeableness is characterized by a propensity\nto appreciate kindness, tradition, and conformity.\nThis trait is closely linked to attributes such as trust,\naltruism, kindness, affection, and various prosocial\nbehaviors, while concurrently avoiding an undue\nr SD(r) ρ SD(ρ)80% Credibility Intervals % Variance Due to Artifacts\nOPE-CON +0.14 0 .15 +0 .20 0 .21 (−0.06,+0.46) 13\nOPE-EXT +0.31 0 .12 +0 .43 0 .09 (+0.30,+0.57) 58\nOPE-AGR +0.14 0 .12 +0 .21 0 .15 (+0.01,+0.41) 21\nOPE-NEU −0.12 0 .12−0.17 0 .15 (−0.36,+0.02) 19\nCON-EXT −0.21 0 .15 +0 .29 0 .16 (+0.06,+0.52) 21\nCON-AGR +0.31 0 .14 +0 .43 0 .12 (+0.26,+0.61) 43\nCON-NEU −0.32 0 .18−0.43 0 .16 (−0.55,−0.16) 24\nEXT-AGR +0.18 0 .15 +0 .26 0 .19 (+0.01,+0.50) 17\nEXT-NEU −0.26 0 .11−0.36 0 .08 (−0.48,−0.23) 53\nAGR-NEU −0.26 0 .14−0.36 0 .09 (−0.55,−0.17) 35\nTable 2: The correlation of five personality traits.

(Sample size N= 144 ,117for the entire\nmeta-analysis)', 'emphasis on power, achievement, or pursuing self-\ncentered pleasures (Roccas et al., 2002). Notably,\nagreeableness exhibited weak correlations with ex-\ntroversion, while demonstrating a negative corre-\nlation with neuroticism, and a positive correlation\nwith conscientiousness (Ones et al., 1996).\nNeuroticism is a personality trait characterized\nby manifestations of sadness, moodiness, and emo-\ntional instability. Components such as neurotic\nanxiety and self-awareness are positively corre-\nlated with traditional values and inversely asso-\nciated with achievement-oriented values. Addi-\ntionally, neuroticism demonstrated weak negative\ncorrelations with both extroversion and openness to\nexperience. Furthermore, it exhibited negative cor-\nrelations with agreeableness and conscientiousness\n(Ones et al., 1996).\nTable 2 shows an analysis of the correlations\namong the five personality traits explored in previ-\nous studies (Van der Linden et al., 2010).\nB Prompt templates\nThe prompt templates utilized in the construction\nof the UBPL’s question set and answer set are de-\npicted in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. Figure 10\nillustrates the prompt template employed when as-\nsessing the degree of personality traits in the model.\nFurthermore, Figure 11 displays the prompt tem-\nplate administered to the Llama2-13b-chat model\nduring the automatic assessment.\nC More Case study\nFigures 12 through 16 show specific cases of us-\ning UBPL to change the personality of LLMs. For\neach case, we show the SJTs question and the corre-\nsponding two answers by models (with and without\nUBPL), and indicate the degree of personality dis-\nplayed by each answer.\nD SJTs4LLMs\nTo comprehensively assess the five personality\ntraits exhibited by the subject model, a system-\natic approach was employed. Initially, we utilized\nTemplate-1, as detailed in Appendix B, to instruct\nGPT-4 in generating 400 situational judgment test\n(SJT) questions for each personality trait category.\nFollowing this, a meticulous manual selection pro-\ncess, involving de-weighting, was applied, result-\ning in the curation of 200 refined SJT questions for\neach personality trait topic. This culminated in a\n•Openness >>>Openness (also known as openness to experience) \nemphasizes imagination and insight. Highly open people tend to have \na wide range of interests. They are curious about the world and others, \nand eager to learn new things and enjoy new experiences. People with \na high score for this trait tend to be more adventurous and creative. \nConversely, people with a low score for this trait tend to be more \ntraditional and may have difficulty with abstract thinking.\n•Conscientiousness >>> Conscientiousness is one defined by high levels \nof thoughtfulness, good impulse control, and goal -directed behaviors. \nHighly conscientious people tend to be organized and mindful of \ndetails. They plan ahead, think about how their behavior affects others, \nand are mindful of deadlines. Someone scoring lower in this primary \npersonality trait is less structured and less organized. They may \nprocrastinate to get things done, sometimes missing deadlines \ncompletely.\n•Extraversion >>> Extraversion (or extroversion) is a personality trait \ncharacterized by excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness, \nand high amounts of emotional expressiveness. People high in \nextraversion are outgoing and tend to gain energy in social situations. \nBeing around others helps them feel energized and excited. People \nwho are low in this personality trait or introverted tend to be more \nreserved. They have less energy to expend in social settings and social \nevents can feel draining. Introverts often require a period of solitude \nand quiet in order to \'recharge.’\n•Agreeableness >>> Agreeableness includes attributes such as trust, \naltruism, kindness, affection, and other prosocial behaviors. People \nwho are high in agreeableness tend to be more cooperative while those \nlow in this personality trait tend to be more competitive and \nsometimes even manipulative.\n•Neuroticism >>> Neuroticism is a personality trait characterized by \nsadness, moodiness, and emotional instability. Individuals who are \nhigh in neuroticism tend to experience mood swings, anxiety, \nirritability, and sadness. Those low in this personality trait tend to be \nmore stable and emotionally resilient.Candidate traits<system>\nYou are a psychologist, and you must know the situational judgment \ntest.  In the situational judgment test, participants express their \nopinions after listening to a situation description, and then \npsychologists analyze their personality traits based on their responses.  \nYou will use this method to evaluate the following characteristics \n(Personality Trait) of the subjects.  In order to conduct the evaluation, \nyou need to construct different language situation descriptions to \ncomplete the detection of the above characteristics.

"How does CLAMP's fine-tuning for visual tasks compare to MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA-1.5, and what are the implications for model capabilities?","['CLAMP: Contrastive Language Model Prompt-tuning 9\nSince we aim for our models to retain their generative abilities in addition\nto gaining discriminative abilities, we show how our models can continue to\ngenerate effectively with both qualitative examples and quantitative metrics,\ne.g., on MMLU [15]. This shows the universality of our model.\nMiniGPT-4 and LLaVA-1.5 are both Vicuna 13B based, sharing an LLM\nfoundation with CLAMP. This means our discriminative parameter adapters\ncan be swapped for their generative adapters, to enable both generative tasks\nand discriminative ones. In this paper, we only evaluate our adapters on the\ndiscriminative task, but combining adapters to produce a single set of adapters\nwould be interesting future work. We do note that MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA-1.5\nuse stronger visual encoders. CLAMP outperforms both zero-shot classification\ntasks by a large margin despite this disadvantage. This also means that currently\none cannot re-use the same visual encoder for captioning or VQA with LLaVA\nadapters, but this can be remedied by training CLAMP with a matching visual\nencoder.\nTraining and Evaluation Setup: For the text encoder, we use a pre-trained\nVicuna13B-1.5 [4], which uses LLaMa2 as a base model. We enable Attention\nPooling, Read-Only Prompting with 24 soft prompts, and LoRA (Section 3.1)\nas the text encoder trainable parameters. For the vision encoder, we use an\nOpenClip pretrained ViT-B-16, and keep it frozen. We train with a data mixture\nof Conceptual Captions 3M [38], Conceptual Captions 12M [2], a 200-million\nscale subset of LAION-400M [37], and ImageNet-21k [9]. All of these datasets,\nexcept for ImageNet21k, are image-caption datasets. In contrast, ImageNet21k\nis a dataset of approximately 21000 labels. In order to convert this to an image-\ncaption dataset, we wrap each label in one of the 80 prompt templates used in\nthe CLIP paper [36]. We train for 480 million seen examples, with a batch size\nof 8192. We use the standard image-text contrastive loss in addition to distilling\na ViT-L-14 trained on DataComp XL [12] into the model. Additional training\ndetails are in the supplementary. When we do zero-shot evaluation, we use a\nprompt template matching the training prompt (Section 3.2).\nBaselines:\nMiniGPT4 [57]: MiniGPT4 learns a linear mapping between the output of\na pre-trained CLIP encoder and a frozen LLM, trained using Conceptual Cap-\ntions. In our experiments, we use a MiniGPT4 with a 16-bit Vicuna13B model.\nLLava-1.5[27]: LLaVa-1.5issimilartoMiniGPTinarchitecture,butwithadif-\nferent data mixture. In particular, LLava-1.5 combines academic VQA datasets\nwith an expansion of COCO by ChatGPT [28] to create a vision-language\ninstruction-following dataset. LLaVA-1.5 also finetunes the LLM with LoRA.\nLiT [54]: To compare to state-of-the art contrastive vision-language models,\nwe train a LiT model, which keeps the vision encoder frozen while updating all\ntext encoder parameters. We initialize with a ViT-B-16 CLIP text encoder from\nscratch, and train on the same data and for the same length as our model. For\nLiT models, we use an evaluation prompt template of ‘A photo of {class}’ . We\nuse a single prompt template for evaluating both LiT and CLAMP.', 'CLAMP: Contrastive Language Model Prompt-tuning 3\na.)

We call our method Contrastive LAnguage Model\nPrompt-tuning (CLAMP) (Fig. 2.) We find that by updating a minority of the\nLLM parameters, our method can approach the performance of zero-shot CLIP\ntrained on much larger scale data while outperforming a text-encoder trained\nfrom scratch on the same data (LiT [54]). This finding highlights the benefits of\nusing Large Language Models; LiT earlier found that initializing to pre-trained\n(but smaller scale) LMs is not helpful for zero-shot classification in English. We\ninstead find that carefully finetuning modern, large language models is help-\nful relative to training a text-encoder from scratch, especially on evaluation\ndatasets which have poor coverage in data used for contrastive training. Surpris-\ningly, we’re alsoable to mostly retain the generative capabilities of the language\nmodel, pointing towards universal generative and discriminative models. Finally,\nbecause we use parameter-efficient finetuning methods for our training and the\nsame base LLM as current instruction-tuned mLLMs, our method makes it pos-\nsible to swap CLAMP’s finetuned parameters with those of mLLMs like LLaVA.\nAs we illustrate in Fig. 1, this enables captioning, VQA, chat and classification\nwith the same foundational LLM.\nIn summary, our contributions are as the follows:\n–We show that SOTA multimodal LLMs are neither accurate nor efficient at\nzero-shot image classification.\n–We train a set of adapter modules with a contrastive loss, which enable an\nLLM to be used for visual discrimination tasks by replacing a text encoder\nin a contrastive vision-language model.\n–We show that the LLM initialization in CLAMP allows for improved perfor-\nmance in domains under-represented in the pre-training data, and that our\nCLAMP retains generative abilities despite our fine-tuning.']","CLAMP outperforms both MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA-1.5 in zero-shot classification tasks by a large margin, despite using a weaker visual encoder.

"How do LLMs boost few-shot recommenders with textual feedback, and how does ChatGPT help with user/item representations?","['Wang: Empowering Few-Shot Recommender Systems with Large Language Models-Enhanced Representations\nresearch [14] suggests that when employed directly and solely\nas a recommender system in few-shot scenarios, LLMs do\nnot demonstrate superior performance across various tasks\ncompared to traditional recommendation models. In contrast,\nrecent studies highlight LLMs’ effective participation in rec-\nommendations as a component of recommender systems [15]\n[16]. This motivates our novel research proposal: investi-\ngating the potential of utilizing LLMs to generate user and\nitem representations using textual explicit feedback, thereby\nenhancing the performance of existing recommender models\nin few-shot scenarios.\nTo investigate this subject, we conduct an in-depth study\nby referencing previous research [14] [17]. We develop a\ntemplate to process movie reviews from a deliberately se-\nlected public dataset using LLMs to generate user and item\nrepresentations. These representations are then incorporated\ninto selected recommendation models for evaluation on two\ntasks: interaction prediction and direct recommendation. To\nspecifically investigate the extraction and association capa-\nbilities of the experimental LLMs, we manually adjusted the\nnumber of training samples to simulate a few-shot scenario.\nComprehensive experimental results indicate that utilizing\nLLMs for representation generation significantly enhances\nthe performance of specific recommendation models in a\nfew-shot scenario, demonstrating that LLMs can effectively\nserve as an explicit feedback processing method for multiple\nrecommendation tasks. Our manual observations also suggest\nthat certain LLMs with generative and logical reasoning capa-\nbilities possess a distinctive ability to generate supplementary\ninformation through association. LLMs’ broad applicability\nacross diverse scenarios and proficiency in processing textual\ninformation even in the absence of quantitative metrics can\naugment the generalization potential of recommender sys-\ntems. It is worth noting that the observed enhancements are\nmore pronounced in recommendation models that integrate\nneural networks. This phenomenon could be attributed to\ninherent constraints imposed by model structures and char-\nacteristics of the embeddings.\nWe hope the results of this experiment can inspire re-\nsearchers to further explore the incorporation of LLMs into\nthe recommendation process, while offering valuable insights\nin specific research fields, such as interpretability, cold-start\nchallenges, and model enhancement within explicit feedback-\ninvolved recommender systems.\nII. RELATED STUDY\nA. EXPLICIT FEEDBACK FOR RECOMMENDATION\nIn contrast to implicit feedback derived primarily from user\nbehavior observations, explicit feedback is openly and ac-\ntively provided by users themselves to reflect their prefer-\nences and attitudes. The concept of explicit feedback men-\ntioned in the book Recommender Systems: An Introduction\nencompasses ratings and annotations [18], while Konstan and\nRiedl [19] broaden its definition to include diverse forms of\nuser-contributed content such as reviews, tags, blog posts,\ntweets, Facebook updates, among others.In previous studies, ratings have been regarded as a crucial\nform of explicit feedback that enhances the performance of\nrecommender systems [20] [21] and can be combined with\nimplicit feedback to cater to diverse recommendation tasks\n[22] [23]. Text, serving as another manifestation of explicit\nfeedback, can also be leveraged by recommender systems.\nTextual explicit feedback is commonly manifested as user\nreviews and comments [24] that are generated in various lan-\nguages [25]. Other forms of textual explicit feedback include\nbut are not limited to Tweets [26], web chats [27], messages\naccompanied by geographic information [28], and Tags [29].\nTherefore, natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial\nrole in constructing recommender systems that rely on textual\nexplicit feedback. Text mining has long been considered as\nan essential prerequisite in various recommendation models\n[24], encompassing techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Al-\nlocation (LDA) [30], TF-IDF [29], word segmentation [25],\nrule-based classifiers [31], and more. The processed text can\nbe leveraged to support recommender systems built through\napproaches such as collaborative filtering [25] [30], content-\nbased filtering [27] or knowledge-based [28].\nIn recent years, the embedding process has emerged as\na prominent focus in recommendation studies due to ad-\nvancements in related research. The utilization of LLMs in\nrecommendation has been increasingly prevalent owing to\ntheir proficiency in comprehending and processing human\nnatural language [32]. Transformer architecture models ( e.g.,\nBERT, GPT, and T5 [33]) have been extensively employed\nin aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting\n[32]. Attention mechanism has also been integrated in the\ndevelopment of recommender system models. For instance,\nNARRE [34], a neural attention recommendation framework\nutilizing user reviews, is introduced to simultaneously pre-\ndict users’ ratings towards items and generate review-level\nexplanations for the prediction. Other attention models such\nas TARMF [35] and MPCN [36] that leverage textual explicit\nfeedback also exhibit superior performance across diverse\nrecommendation tasks compared to existing deep learning-\nbased recommendation models ( e.g., ConvMF [37], Deep-\nCoNN [38]).\nB. CHATGPT FOR RECOMMENDATION\nReleased by OpenAI in 2022, ChatGPT [39] is an advanced\nLLM and dialogue system that has demonstrated exceptional\nperformance across various vertical domains. It showcases re-\nmarkable capabilities in context-based comprehension, sum-\nmarization, and text generation [12]. The investigation into\nthe methodology of transferring and employing ChatGPT’s\nextensive knowledge and paradigm acquired from large-\nscale corpora to recommendation scenarios has emerged as\na cutting-edge pursuit in the academic domain.\nChatGPT can independently serve as a versatile recom-\nmendation model capable of handling various recommen-\ndation tasks.

EVALUATION\nTo assess the effectiveness of LLMs as a textual explicit\nfeedback processing method for recommender systems, we\nconduct ablation studies on diverse tasks with the aim of\nanswer the following research questions:\n•RQ1: Do the LLM-processed user and item represen-\ntations exhibit disparities compared to the original re-\nviews?\n•RQ2: How effectively do these representation function\nacross different recommendation models and tasks, in a\nfew-shot scenario?\n•RQ3: Do the textual representations generated by Chat-\nGPT in our experiment possess additional observable\nattributes and features, beyond those demonstrated in the\naforementioned experiment results?\nA. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n1) Workflow\nBuilding upon previous studies [13] [14], we design our\nexperimental workflow as follows: Firstly, we construct eli-\ngible datasets that include explicit user feedback and relevant\ninformation (Section 4.B). Secondly, the select user profiles\nand reviews are transformed into prompts for ChatGPT to\ngenerate textual user and item representations (elaborated in\nSection 3). Thirdly, the textual representations generated by\nChatGPT undergo manual observation for case study pur-poses (Section 4.E) while concurrently being embedded by\nusing MacBERT to construct an experimental dataset. Finally,\nthe experimental dataset is incorporated into selected recom-\nmendation models for various recommendation tasks(Section\n4.C, 4.D), along with control datasets. The complete work-\nflow of our experimental process is illustrated in Fig.2.\n2) Baselines and Metrics\nIn Section 4.C, we examine the disparities between the em-\nbeddings in the experimental dataset (ChatGPT-processed\nand MacBERT-embedded) and the embeddings in the control\ndataset (non-ChatGPT-processed and MacBERT-embedded).\nWe employ three statistical methods [45], namely cosine\nsimilarity, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance, to\nquantify the semantic relationships between embeddings of\neach subject (user/item) across the two datasets, namely\nembX from the experimental datasets and embX′from the\ncontrol datasets. We computed the mean cosine similarity,\nmean Manhattan distance, and mean Euclidean distance by\naveraging the results across all the subjects. The formula is\npresented below, where nrepresents the size of the dataset\nanddis the length of an individual embedding (1,024 for\nMacBERT embeddings):\n4 VOLUME 11, 2023']","LLMs boost few-shot recommenders with textual feedback by generating user and item representations from textual explicit feedback, such as reviews and comments.

What metrics assess KGQA on datasets with answer entities 2-4 hops from the topic entity on Freebase?,"['A Experiment Setup\nA.1 Datasets\nWe select four popular complex KGQA datasets\nas in-domain datasets, i.e., WebQuestionsSP (We-\nbQSP) (Yih et al., 2016), Complex WebQues-\ntions 1.1 (CWQ) (Talmor and Berant, 2018), and\nGrailQA (Gu et al., 2021), which are based on\nFreebase, and KQA Pro (Cao et al., 2022), which\nis based on Wikidata. And we select three repre-\nsentative ODQA datasets as out-domain datasets,\nwhich are WebQuestions (WQ) (Berant et al., 2013),\nNatural Questions (NQ) (Chen et al., 2017), and\nTriviaQA (TQ) (Joshi et al., 2017). Since we only\nrely on the KG to answer questions, we filter the\nquestions in ODQA datasets that can not be linked\nto any entity in KG, denoted as WQ-Freebase ,NQ-\nWiki, and TQ-Wiki , respectively. Besides, we fur-\nther select the MetaQA (Zhang et al., 2018), which\nis based on a domain-specific movie KG, to eval-\nuate the generalibility of our method. The detail\ndescription of these selected datasets is as follows:\n•WebQSP consists of 4,737 questions. The\nanswer entities are within a maximum of 2 hops\nfrom the topic entity on the Freebase KG. We adopt\nthe train/valid/test splits from GraftNet (Sun et al.,\n2018) for consistency.\n•CWQ is constructed based on WebQSP, which\nis more challenging. It complicates WebQSP by ex-\ntending the question entities or adding constraints\nto restrict the answers. The answer entities are\nwithin a maximum of 4 hops from the topic entity\non the Freebase KG.\n•GrailQA consists of 64,331 questions. Com-\npared to WebQSP and CWQ, it focuses on a more\ncomprehensive generalization capability evaluation\nfrom three levels ( i.e., i.i.d, compositional, and\nzero-shot).\n•KQA Pro consists of 117,970 questions. The\nabove three datasets are based on Freebase, and it\nis based on Wikidata, and require multiple reason-\ning capabilities including compositional reasoning,\nmulti-hop reasoning, quantitative comparison, set\noperations, and etc.\n•MetaQA comprises over 400,000 questions\nbased on a movie domain KG, with answer enti-\nties located up to three hops away from the topic\nentities. Based on the number of hops, the dataset\nis divided into three sub-datasets: MetaQA-1hop,\nMetaQA-2hop, and MetaQA-3hop. Following ex-\nisting work (He et al., 2021), we randomly sample\njust one training case for each question templatefrom the original training set, to form a one-shot\ntraining dataset.\n•WQ consists of 6,642 questions. The questions\nare mostly centered around a single named entity\nand are supposed to be answerable by Freebase KG.\nWe extract xx questions from the original test set\nto compose the WQ-freebase subset.\n•NQconsists of 323,045 questions. Each exam-\nple contains a question from the Google search\nand the corresponding answers, which are text\nspans on the Wikipedia page. Following existing\nwork (Roberts et al., 2020), we use the open version\nof this dataset which discards answers with more\nthan 5 tokens. We extract xx questions from the\noriginal test set to compose the NQ-Wiki subset.\n•TQconsists of 110K questions. Each example\ncontains a question authored by trivia enthusiasts,\nand the answers are text spans from the Web or\nWikipedia. Following existing work (Roberts et al.,\n2020), we use its unfiltered version for evaluation.\nWe extract xx questions from the original test set\nto compose the TQ-Wiki subset.\nA.2 Evaluation Protocol\nFor KGQA, following existing work (Sun et al.,\n2018), we use Hits@1 and F1 metrics for WebQSP\nand CWQ datasets, F1 metric for GrailQA dataset,\nand Hits@1 for MetaQA. The Hits@1 evaluates\nthe correctness of the top-ranked answer while F1\nconsiders coverage of all the predicted answers. It’s\nworth noting that some baselines and our approach\nwould return all the unordered answers at the end,\nwhich is not suitable for the Hist@1 metric. For\na comprehensive comparison, we randomly select\none answer per question as the top-ranked answer\nand then calculate the average Hits@1 result by\nrepeating this process 100 times following existing\nwork (Shu et al., 2022). For ODQA, following\nexisting work (Roberts et al., 2020), we report the\nEM metric, which evaluates whether the predicted\nanswer is the same as the gold one after performing\nnormalization.\nA.3 Baselines for Comparison\nFor KGQA, we consider the following three types\nof baseline methods for performance comparison:\n•subgraph-based reasoning methods which\nperform answer reasoning in a retrieval subgraph\nform KG, including GrafeNet (Sun et al., 2018),\nNSM (He et al., 2021), SubgraphRetrieval (Zhang\net al., 2022), UniKGQA (Jiang et al., 2023d), and\nReasoningLM (Jiang et al., 2023c) for datasets', 'ModelWebQSP CWQ GrailQA (F1)\nHits@1 F1 Hits@1 F1 Overall I.I.D.

The KG-Agent\nframework autonomously iterates the above tool\nselection and memory updation process to perform\nstep-by-step reasoning, where the knowledge mem-\nory is used to maintain the accessed information\nfrom KG. In this way, the multi-turn decision-\nmaking process of the agent is like walking on the\nKG along relations. Once reaching the answer enti-\nties, the agent will automatically stop the iterative\nprocess. Note that the whole process is agnostic to\nthe task types ( e.g., question answering) and some\nspecific KGs. Therefore, our approach is a gen-\neral framework that can be applied to a variety of\ncomplex tasks that require reasoning over any KGs.\n4.4 Comparison to Previous Work\nExisting methods of reasoning over KG can be cat-\negorized into two classes based on their workflow.\nThe first line of research, such as KB-BINDER (Li\net al., 2023), Pangu (Gu et al., 2023), Struct-\nGPT (Jiang et al., 2023b), and RoG (Luo et al.,\n2023), crafted a pre-defined interaction way be-tween LLM and KG, which cannot flexibly adapt\nto various complex tasks. Another line of research,\nsuch as ChatBD (Hu et al., 2023a), conducted\nautonomous reasoning with chain-of-thought and\nmemory augmented. However, it relies on the\nstrong closed-source LLM APIs ( e.g., ChatGPT)\nand cannot use tools to implement some special-\nized operations ( e.g., count). Our KG-Agent is the\nfirst autonomous agent framework to support the\ncomplex interaction between LLM and KG with\ntool and memory augmented. Furthermore, we\nimplement this autonomous agent by instruction\ntuning a smaller 7B open-source LLM compared\nto the backbone LLM in KB-BINDER, Struct-\nGPT, and ChatDB. At the same time, the agent\ninstruction tuning data is constructed from various\nKGs ( e.g., Wikidata and Freebase), which helps\nour KG-Agent to learn the general autonomous\ndecision making capabilities over various KGs.\n5 Experiment\n5.1 Experimental Setup\nWe select four commonly-used KGQA datasets\nas in-domain datasets, i.e., WebQSP ,CWQ , and\nGrailQA , which are based on Freebase, and KQA\nPro, which is based on Wikidata. And we select\nthree ODQA datasets as out-of-domain datasets,\ni.e., WQ ,NQ, and TQ.

"How do exemplar placement and diversity impact GPT-4's multilingual translation, esp. for low-resource langs?","['LLM may struggle to acquire helpful translation\nknowledge from semantically-related exemplars.\nExemplars teach LLM the core feature of trans-\nlation task To better understand how ICL exem-\nplars influence LLM to understand the translation\ntask, we observe LLM’s translation behaviour un-\nder abnormal in-context exemplars (Table 4).\nWe can see that LLM completely fails when\nmismatched translation is used as exemplars, indi-\ncating that LLM needs to learn from the context to\nkeep source and target sentence semantically con-\nsistent. Word-level15and document-level16transla-\ntion exemplar degenerates LLM’s translation per-\nformance, which demonstrates that the translation\ngranularity of exemplar matters as well. Another in-\nteresting phenomenon is that LLM performs worse\nwhen duplicated translation is used as the exem-\nplar, indicating that keeping in-context exemplars\ndiverse is also important. In general, these compar-\nison results show that LLM learns the core feature\nof translation task through in-context learning.\nThe exemplar in the tail of the prompt has more\nimpact on the LLM’s behaviour During our\nanalysis, we find that reversing the translation direc-\ntion of exemplars will cause LLM to fail.

Similar\nto the findings of Zhang et al.

We find that translation capabili-\nties of LLMs are continually improving and GPT-\n4 reaches new performance height. But even for\nGPT-4, it still face challenge on low-resource lan-\nguages. In our analysis, we find that LLMs ex-\nhibit new working patterns when used for MMT.\nFor example, instruction semantics can be ignored\nduring in-context learning and cross-lingual exem-\nplars can provide better task instruction for low-\nresource translation. More importantly, we find that\nLLM can acquire translation ability in a resource-\nefficient way, which indicates the promising future\nof LLM in multilingual machine translation.', 'tions (202 English-centric directions, 202 French-\ncentric directions and 202 Chinese-centric direc-\ntions). Results show that the multilingual transla-\ntion capabilities of LLMs are continually improv-\ning and GPT-4 reaches new performance height.\nCompared with the widely-used supervised MMT\nsystem NLLB (Costa-jussà et al., 2022), GPT-4\nachieves higher performance on 40.91% English-\ncentric translation directions. But compared with\nthe commercial translation system (Google Trans-\nlator), LLMs still have a long way to go, partic-\nularly when it comes to low-resource languages.\nFrench-centric and Chinese-centric translation are\nmore challenging for GPT-4 than English-centric\ntranslation, which further indicates its unbalanced\ncapability across languages.\nFor the second question, we find some new work-\ning patterns. First, LLMs are able to perform trans-\nlation even with unreasonable instructions if in-\ncontext learning exemplars are given. However, if\ngiven mismatched translation pairs as in-context\nexemplars, LLMs fail to translate, which is similar\nto observations from concurrent studies (Wei et al.,\n2023). This shows the importance of exemplars in\nICL for machine translation. Second, we find that\ncross-lingual translation pairs can be surprisingly\ngood exemplars for low-resource translation, even\nbetter than exemplars in the same language. Third,\nwe discover that LLM can acquire translation abil-\nity in a resource-efficient way and generate moder-\nate translation even on zero-resource languages.\nThe main contribution of this paper can be sum-\nmarized below:\n•We benchmark popular LLMs on MMT in\n102 languages and 606 translation directions,\ncovering English-centric, French-centric and\nChinese-centric translation.\n•We systematically compare the results of\nLLMs and three strong supervised base-\nlines (M2M-100, NLLB, Google Translator)\nand reveal the gap between two translation\nparadigms.\n•We find some new ICL working patterns of\nLLMs for MMT and discuss corresponding\nadvantages and challenges.\n2 Background\n2.1 Large Language Models\nLanguage modeling is a long-standing task in nat-\nural language processing (Bengio et al., 2000;Mikolov et al., 2010; Khandelwal et al., 2020),\nwhich is a task to predict the probability of the\nnext token. Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017)\nbasically is the backbone of existing LLMs.\nLLMs show great potential as a universal multi-\ntask learner. Recently, Radford et al. (2019) find\nthat a casual decoder-only language model can be a\nmulti-task learner with merely unsupervised train-\ning corpus. Later, Kaplan et al. (2020) reveal the\nscaling law of LLM, indicating that when the scale\nof neural parameters and training data keeps in-\ncreasing, LLM can be further strengthened. Wei\net al. (2022b) show that scaling the language model\nalso brings astonishing emergent abilities , e.g., in-\ncontext learning, which is only present in large\nmodels. Consequently, more and more efforts have\nbeen put into scaling-up language models (Brown\net al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Scao et al.,\n2022; Vilar et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2023). Among\nthem, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and ChatGPT (Ope-\nnAI, 2022) are the most representative systems,\nwhich shows impressive results in various NLP\ntasks.\n2.2 Emergent Ability: In-context Learning\nIn-context learning is one of the well-known emer-\ngent abilities (Brown et al., 2020; Dong et al.,\n2022), which enables LLM to learn target tasks\naccording to the prompt without updating any pa-\nrameters.\nSpecifically, the prompt is made up of in-context\nexemplars {(Xi,Yi)}k\ni=1and in-context template\nT. Exemplars are often picked from supervised\ndata, where Yiis the ground truth corresponding\nto the input sentence Xi. Template Tis usually a\nhuman-written instruction related to the target task.\nWrapping exemplars with the template and concate-\nnating them together produce the final prompt:\nP=T(X1,Y1)⊕ T(X2,Y2)⊕ ··· ⊕ T (Xk,Yk)\nwhere ⊕denotes the concatenation symbol, e.g.,\nwhitespace, line-break. During inference, LLM is\nable to generate the corresponding output Yof the\ntest sample Xunder the guidance of the prompt:\narg max\nYp(P ⊕ T (X,Y)) (1)\nFor label prediction tasks, the prediction Ycan\nbe obtained in one-step generation.

Setup\nWe consider both open-source LLMs, e.g., Llama-2-70b-\nchat, CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, Mistral-7b-Orca, and com-\nmercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4-0613, GPT-3.5-1106. For all\nthe LLMs, the temperature is set to 0.2 and the max number\nof tokens is 1024. For each competition, we run 50 valid\nmatches. The final performance is measured by the averaged\nNRA over the 50 valid matches. To mitigate the first-player\nadvantage, we let each participant be the first to go for 25\nmatches.4.2. Complete and Deterministic Gaming\nThere are four complete and deterministic tasks sup-\nported in GTB ENCH :Tic-Tac-Toe ,Connect-4 ,\nBreakthrough , and Nim. We compare LLM-driven\nagents with Random Agent and MCTS Agent to show\nwhether LLMs are capable of gaming incomplete infor-\nmation and deterministic scenarios. Results are summarized\nin Figure 2. In general, we show that all LLMs achieve sub-\nstantial relative advantages when compared against Random\nAgent. The best result is achieved by GPT-4 w/ CoT rea-\nsoning. For open-source LLMs, CodeLlama-34b-Instruct\nis slightly better than Llama-2-70b-chat. In Section 4.4,\nwe further reveal that CodeLlama-34b-Instruct substantially\noutperforms Llama-2-70b-chat in the LLM-vs-LLM scenar-\nios. This verifies recent discoveries where code-pretraining\nmay benefit logical reasoning (Madaan et al., 2022).\nHowever, all the LLMs with various reasoning methods\nachieve NRA as −1when against the MCTS Agent, mean-\ning that LLM-driven agents can barely win even a single\nmatch.

Therefore,\nLLMs remain noncompetitive in complete and deterministic\ngaming.\n4.3. Probabilistic and Dynamic Gaming\nThere are five probabilistic game-theoretic gaming tasks:\nKuhn Poker ,Liar’s Dice ,Blind Auction ,\nNegotiation ,Pig, and one additional dynamic task:\nIterated Prisoner’s Dilemma . We group these\ngames together as they all involve stochasticity in the game-\nplay, which is different from complete and deterministic\ngaming. The Random Agent as the opponent is omitted for\nboth Negotiation and Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma because\nthe Random Agent rarely chooses to collaborate, resulting\nin meaningless evaluation.\nResults are summarized in Figure 3. It is shown that Liar’s\nDice shares a similar trend as the complete and determinis-\ntic scenarios (Figure 2), where LLM-driven agents achieve\nNRA near −1when against the MCTS Agent. This is be-\ncause the 2-player Liar’s Dice has very limited stochas-\nticity, making the gameplay tend to be complete information.\nFor other tasks, we found that LLMs do not always fail. We\nobserve that the NRA of LLM agents is close to 0 over\nall the tasks, indicating that they are equally competitive\nas conventional solvers or even better (e.g., Kuhn Poker\nwhere GPT-4 outperforms MCTS Agent).\n4.4.

"How does LMC OR boost LLMs w/o model weights, and how does it stack up against other feedback methods?","['et al., 2023). Secondly, the increasing scale of\nLLMs makes fine-tuning on standard hardware\ncomputationally infeasible. To address these issues,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have been\nproposed (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lester et al., 2021;\nLi and Liang, 2021; Hu et al., 2022). Although\nthese methods are more computationally efficient,\nthey still require access to the model weights and\nsubstantial computational resources for loading and\nupdating the model. Furthermore, due to the com-\nmercialization of LLMs, they are often available\nonly through restricted inference APIs.\nIn light of these challenges, we propose a method\nthat leverages only the outputs of LLMs to enhance\ntheir performance. Our work targets scenarios\nwhere training data is available, but extreme com-\nputational resources are not. To this end, we intro-\nduce LM-Corrector ( LMC OR), a compact model\nthat corrects the predictions produced by the LLM.\nUnlike fine-tuning methods, our approach operates\ndirectly on the LLM outputs, bypassing the need\nfor access to their weights.\nLMC ORcapitalizes on the observation that\nLLMs can generate a diverse array of candidates\nfor a single input which are often complimentary.\nThus, it is possible to produce a superior output\nby optimally combining spans from different can-\ndidates (see Figure 2). LMC ORreceives multiple\ncandidates for a single input and learns to optimally\nrank, combine, and edit them, ultimately yielding\nmore precise and higher-quality outputs. Figure 1\nillustrates our approach, where LMC ORrewrites\nthe first output of the LLM while incorporating cor-\nrect spans from the second ( American ) and the third\noutputs ( the Nobel ) to produce the final, corrected\noutput.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows.\n(1) We introduce LMC OR, a method to improve the\nperformance of LLMs in the presence of training\ndata without access to the model weights. (2) We\nconduct experiments on four natural language gen-\neration tasks where LLMs underperform special-\nized models. We demonstrate that a small LMC OR\nmodel with only 250 million parameters improves\nthe performance of an LLM with 62 billion parame-\nters, matching or even outperforming task-specific\nmodels. (3) We showcase that the corrector is ro-\nbust to different prompts, alleviating the need for\nextensive prompt engineering.

Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, our\napproach does not require access to the weights of\nthe LLM. Instead, as seen in Figure 1, we interact\nwith the LLM only through an API, as is the case\nfor some state-of-the-art commercial LLMs.\nHeadroom analysis Our approach is based on\nthe insight that LLMs can generate a diverse pool\nof candidates for each input, with complementary\nstrengths and weaknesses. Thus, an improved out-\nput can be produced by combining the correct\nparts of the corresponding candidates. To illustrate\nthis, we experiment on the task of grammatical\nerror correction (GEC) (Ng et al., 2014) using\nPaLM models (Chowdhery et al., 2022) of vary-\ning size, depicted in Figure 2. First, we observe\nthat the few-shot PaLM models underperform fine-\ntuned 11B-parameter state-of-the-art (sota) GEC\nmodel (Rothe et al., 2021). However, by sampling\n10 times from the LLM and employing an oracle to\nrank the samples (oracle-rank) or to combine cor-\nrect spans (oracle-combine2), we obtain significant\nimprovements, surpassing state-of-the-art.\nThis finding highlights the potential of leverag-\ning multiple generations through ranking or com-\n1https://github.com/GeorgeVern/lmcor\n2For the oracle-combine we compute the differing spans\nbetween the candidates and for each span we choose the one\nthat has the smallest edit distance with the target.', 'from external models such as Google Search, doc-\nument retrievers, compilers (Gao et al., 2021; Yao\net al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2023), or\nfrom a separate model trained to provide feedback\non LLM outputs with additional supervision (Paul\net al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Akyürek et al., 2023).\nWhile leveraging the LLM itself to generate feed-\nback has been explored (Madaan et al., 2023; Shinn\net al., 2023), it tends to yield lower-quality feed-\nback (Akyürek et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2023; Huang\net al., 2023) and involves multiple passes and exten-\nsive prompt engineering for each LLM operation.\nIn contrast, our approach is task-agnostic and re-\nquires a single pass from the LLM, with little to no\nprompt engineering, offering an efficient solution\nfor enhancing LLM outputs.\nRecently, studies have highlighted the potential\nof smaller, task-specific models to complement the\npredictions of an LLM. Xu et al. (2023) explore\na framework where candidates produced by task-\nspecific models are fed to an LLM, primarily tar-\ngeting classification task while LMC ORis better-\nsuited for open-ended generation tasks. Welleck\net al. (2023) train a smaller model to iteratively\nimprove sequences generated by LLMs. In con-\ntrast to our method, they rely on unlabeled data\nand sample extensively from the LLM to obtain a\nlarge pool of candidates. They assume the availabil-\nity of a value function that assigns scores to each\ncandidate and create input-output pairs by sorting\ncandidates based on their scores. Unlike their ap-\nproach, we demonstrate that a compact corrector\ncan perform effectively across various tasks. Ad-\nditionally, our approach is more efficient during\ninference, since the ability of LMC ORto process\nmultiple candidates simultaneously eliminates the\nneed for multiple passes.\nConcurrently, researchers have begun to lever-\nage the complementary nature of LLM-generated\noutputs during inference. Farinhas et al. (2023)\nuse an LLM to combine its generated outputs for\nmachine translation, although they find that rerank-\ning methods incorporating external modules, such\nas quality estimation metrics (Zerva et al., 2022),\nprove to be more efficient. Meanwhile, Vernikos\nand Popescu-Belis (2024) propose an approach that\nuses a quality estimation metric to combine the\noutputs of LLMs or MT models. Similar to our\nmethod, they exploit the diversity of LLM outputs\nby identifying divergent spans among candidates\nand merging them based on the metric.Most relevant to our approach is the work by\nJiang et al. (2023) where they propose a method\nto ensemble LLMs. Their pipeline consists of i)\nsampling a large pool of candidates, ii) selecting\ntop candidates via multiple pairwise comparisons\nthrough a trained reranker and iii) fusing them us-\ning a similar technique as LMC OR. While our\napproach could be extended to multiple LLMs\nwe demonstrate improvements with a single LLM,\nleveraging the complimentarity of the generations.\nIn addition, our approach is more efficient since we\nuse a much smaller model as the corrector (3B vs\n250M) and do not introduce additional training and\ninference steps for ranking the outputs.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we introduce LMC OR, a novel ap-\nproach that leverages a small corrector module to\nenhance the performance of LLMs in the presence\nof training data. LMC ORleverages the diversity of\nthe LLM generations to rank, edit and combine the\ncandidates. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethods, our approach does not require access to\nthe model or substantial computational resources.\nOur experiments demonstrate that even a relatively\nsmall corrector (250M) can improve the perfor-\nmance of a much larger LM (62B), while exhibiting\nrobustness against different prompts. Furthermore,\nwe showcase that the corrector can be successfully\napplied to models of different scale or architec-\nture without any retraining. These findings offer\na promising solution for improving LLM perfor-\nmance in a practical and resource-efficient manner\nand open up new possibilities for the utilization\nand deployment of LLMs in real-world applica-\ntions alongside smaller task-specific models.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful for their support to the Swiss\nNational Science Foundation (DOMAT grant n.\n175693, On-demand Knowledge for Document-\nlevel Machine Translation), and to the Institute\nfor ICT at HEIG-VD.

"How does LLM-CF handle efficient recommendations with real-time data updates, esp. for new users/items?","['Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Zhongxiang Sun, Zihua Si, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Xiao Zhang, and Jun Xu\nUserItem\nRecommendation ModelRetrieveWorld Knowledge and Reasoning guided CF LabelRecommendation DataRecGen-LLaMA\nReasoning andWorld Knowledge\nCoTRecommendation Features\nOnline serviceOffline serviceSimilar ExamplesIn-context CoT Dataset\nInstructionTuning+\nGeneral Data\nFigure 1: LLM-CF integrates LLM-based world knowledge\nand reasoning with collaborative filtering to improve rec-\nommendation performance, using LLMs with recommender\ncapability and decoupled latency-free offline generation.\nConsidering the challenges in deploying LLMs as RSs due to\ntheir inherently extensive parameterization, we focus on LLM-\nenhanced RSs , which are more applicable and flexible for ex-\nisting RSs. In order to better guide collaborative filtering to en-\nhance existing RSs with LLMs. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nand In-Context Learning [ 4,10] in LLMs, we propose a novel\nLargeLanguage Models enhanced Collaborative Filtering ( LLM-\nCF) Framework, which distils the world knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities of LLM into collaborative filtering in an in-context,\nchain of thought methodology. As shown in Figure 1, LLM-CF can\nbe decoupled into two parts: (1) offline service part (§ 4) : Fine-\ntune LLM to enhance its recommendation capabilities, generate CoT\nreasoning with collaborative filtering information, and construct\nin-context CoT dataset. (2) online service part (§ 5): Retrieve the\nin-context CoT examples, learn the world knowledge and reasoning\nguided Collaborative Filtering (CF) feature, and use this feature to\nenhance existing RSs.\nIn the offline service, we perform instruction tuning on LLM to\nobtain CF information about users and items in the recommenda-\ntion data. However, our initial findings indicate that full parameter\ntuning LLMs could result in substantial forgetting of their gen-\neral capabilities, as discussed in § 4.2. We leveraged a simple but\neffective data mixing method to finetune LLaMA2 [ 39], and success-\nfully trained a model RecGen-LLaMA , which achieves an optimal\nbalance between general and recommendation capabilities. Then,\nwe use RecGen-LLaMA to generate CoT reasoning for a subset of\nexamples in training data, forming the in-context CoT dataset.\nIn the online service, the retrieval module uses a query composed\nof the textual features of the current recommendation features to\nperform embedding-based retrieval on the in-context CoT dataset,\nforming in-context CoT examples. These retrieved examples con-\ntain similar recommendation features, as well as CoT reasoning\ngenerated by RecGen-LLaMA. The in-context CoT examples are\nconcatenated with the current recommendation features and then\nfed into the In-context Chain of Thought ( ICT) module of LLM-CF\nto learn world-knowledge and reasoning guided CF feature. Finally,\nthe enhanced CF feature is fed into the backbone recommendation\nmodel for making the final prediction.\nAdvantage: LLM-CF not only leverages LLMs to provide en-\nhanced collaborative filtering information to existing RSs but alsoachieves exceptional deployment efficiency. (1) We teach collab-\norative filtering knowledge from recommendation data to LLMs,\nensuring that the generated texts include a comprehensive under-\nstanding of user behaviors and item features. (2) When integrating\nthe world knowledge and reasoning capabilities from LLMs into\nRSs, We design ICT modules that embody both these capabilities\nand collaborative filtering information. This information comes\nfrom the explicit collaborative filtering information contained in\nthe retrieved similar user histories and the RecGen-LLaMA gener-\nated CoT reasoning. (3) The time cost of LLM-CF is manageable,\nas we only require the offline serving of LLM without the need for\nonline inference alongside the RSs.\nWe summarize the major contributions of this paper as follows:\n(1) We represent pioneering work in using the LLMs-based world\nknowledge and reasoning to guide collaborative filtering features,\nthereby enhancing conventional recommendation models.\n(2) The proposed LLM-CF is inspired by in-context learning and\nchain of thought reasoning in LLMs, which effectively distills the\nworld knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into conven-\ntional recommendation models in an in-context chain of thought\nmanner. Moreover, the LLM-CF is more efficient compared to ex-\nisting LLM-enhanced RSs by decoupling LLM generation from the\nrecommendation system’s online services.\n(3) We conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-CF could signif-\nicantly improve the recommendation performance of conventional\nrecommendation models in both ranking and retrieval tasks, veri-\nfying the effectiveness of the LLM-CF.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 LLM as RSs\nLLMs as RSs involve directly prompting LLMs to make recommen-\ndations using natural language-based queries or adapting LLMs\nto serve as RSs after fine-tuning them with recommendation data.\nP5 [11] transforms user interaction data into text prompts using\nitem indices for training language models. In contrast, TALLRec [ 2]\nutilizes instructional designs to outline recommendation tasks and\nadapts LLMs through fine-tuning to follow these guidelines, thereby\nproducing recommendations. Further, ReLLa [ 24] uses retrieved\nuser history to fine-tune LLMs, addressing the issue of LLMs’ weak\ncapability in processing long user sequences.

Then, this history and the chosen items are\nfed into the LLM as text using a specially crafted prompt template.\nHowever, directly using LLMs as inference models for recommen-\ndation tasks presents challenges, such as high computational costs\nand slow inference times, causing challenges in meeting the re-\nquirements for online services and deployment.\n2.2 LLM-enhanced RSs\nLLM-enhanced RSs leverage the world knowledge and reasoning\nabilities of LLMs by utilizing them to generate knowledge-rich texts\nor employ LLM-derived embeddings as features to enhance RSs.\nGIRL [ 51] applies an LLM, fine-tuned with job datasets, to create\njob descriptions from CVs, boosting traditional job RSs.

This phenomenon was also observed in\nthe case of RecGen-LLaMA trained with half the recommendation\ndata (i.e., Rec(Half)Gen ). This further proves that in real-world\nRecommender Systems scenarios, we can use a small amount of rec-\nommendation data to fine-tune LLMs to enhance recommendation\ncapability, thereby significantly reducing the training overhead of\nRecGen-LLaMA in real-world Recommender Systems.\nGeneration: In the generation phase, we compared LLM-CF\nwith the currently most efficient LLM-enhanced RSs approach\nKAR [ 46], which achieves a certain speed-up with prestore genera-\ntion when user features and item features are relatively fixed. In\nour efficiency analysis, we have more thoroughly considered three\nscenarios (i.e., new interactions, new users, new items). Our model’s\ndecoupling of generation and online recommendation effectivenessis evident from Table 1. In all three scenarios, our model does not\nrequire real-time generation to meet online recommendation needs.\nThis is particularly significant for scenarios like short-video recom-\nmendations, where many new items appear daily, further reducing\nthe time delay in system online services.\n5 ONLINE SERVICE OF LLM-CF\nIn this section, we introduce the online service of LLM-CF in detail.\n5.1 Overview\nThe online service part of LLM-CF includes the following compo-\nnents:\nIn-context CoT Examples Retrieval : The Retrieval process\ninvolves finding the top- 𝐾historical recommendation examples\nsimilar to the current recommendation data in order to provide\nexplicit collaborative filtering information. This involves identify-\ningI𝑖={(x𝑘,𝑐𝑘,𝑦𝑘)}𝐾\n𝑘=1fromC, which includes recommendation\ndata similar to the current recommendation data, as well as CoT rea-\nsoning𝑐𝑘containing world-knowledge and collaborative filtering\ninformation.\nIn-context Chain of Thought (ICT) Module : Inspired by\nthe success of in-context learning and chain of thought in LLMs,\nwe useI𝑖as in-context CoT examples and x𝑖as the query. By\nemploying a transformer decoder layer for In-context Chain of\nThought learning, we learnt the world-knowledge and reasoning\nguided collaborative filtering feature w𝑖, which can be used to\nenhance underlying recommendation models in a model-agnostic\nmanner.\nTraining : During the training phase, we designed a reconstruc-\ntion loss for the CoT reasoning in the in-context examples, to fur-\nther strengthen the world-knowledge and reasoning capabilities\ncontained in the collaborative filtering features generated by ICT\nmodule.\n5.2 In-context CoT Examples Retrieval\nThe Retrieval module is responsible for retrieving similar In-context\nCoT examples for the current recommendation data (x𝑖,𝑦𝑖). Re-\ncent studies in retrieval-augmented recommendation have shown\nthe potential of using current recommendation features (i.e., user\nfeatures and target item features) for history retrieval to enhance\ncollaborative filtering capabilities [ 3,31,32]. Our approach extends\nthis concept by not only leveraging the collaborative filtering infor-\nmation but also incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning\nabilities of RecGen-LLaMA.\nWe use the text format features x𝑡\n𝑖ofx𝑖as the query to retrieve\nsimilar In-context CoT examples from the In-context CoT dataset\nC, where the key for the examples in Cis composed of the text\nformat features:K=[x𝑡\n1,..., x𝑡𝑚,..., x𝑡\n𝑀].\nWe employed embedding-based retrieval, including the encoding\nand ranking processes. To implement this process efficiently, the\nretrieval process is based on the Approximate Nearest Neighbor\nsearch [ 27]. In the Encoding phase, we used the BGE embedding [ 47]\nas the text encoder to convert the query x𝑡\n𝑖and the candidate keys\nof the In-context CoT dataset Kinto embedding formats:\ne(x𝑡\n𝑖),e(K)=encoder(x𝑡\n𝑖),encoder(K),']","LLM-CF handles efficient recommendations with real-time data updates by decoupling the generation of collaborative filtering information from the recommendation system’s online services. This means that LLM-CF does not require real-time generation of new data for new users or items, allowing it to maintain high efficiency and reduce time delays in system online services.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2403.17688v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2403.17688v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1355738, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '2403.17688v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2403.17688v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1355738, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

The ﬁrst group consists of\ntheClosed-Book Models , which are pre-trained\nor ﬁne-tuned speciﬁcally for the medical do-\nmain.

In\nthe evidence retrieval stage, SPLADE acts as our\nsparse retriever, DPR is the dense retriever, and\nwe incorporate a cross-encoder for reranking.

We optimize prompt training to enhance the accuracy of LLMs’\ncausal inference in Section 3.2, aligning with the baseline accuracy component described by the\nfirst term in Definitions 2.1 and 2.2. Subsequent experiments are then meticulously designed\nto measure LLMs’ performance in the absence of knowledge (see Section 3.3), data (see Section\n3.1), or both (see Section 3.5), corresponding to the second terms in Definition 2.1, Definition\n2.2, and Definitions 2.3-2.4, respectively. The findings from our causal attribution model sug-\ngest that the numerical data may have a limited role in LLMs’ causal analysis, prompting us to\nfurther investigate through a reverse causal inference experiment in Section 3.6 and a pairwise\ncausal discovery experiment in Section 3.7. These two experiments will challenge the models’\nreliance on numerical data for causal reasoning. To ensure a robust and general evaluation,\nwe employ a suite of general-purpose autoregressive LLMs based on GPT (Radford et al.,\n2019): GPT-3.5, known as ChatGPT, and its more advanced counterparts, GPT-4 and GPT-4\n7', 'of this knowledge actually detracts from the model’s ability to reason causally, leading to less\naccurate predictions.

How do LLMs' robustness in numeric and grammatical variations affect performance in Chinese industries?,"['Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Zongjie Li, Wenying Qiu, Pingchuan Ma, Yichen Li, You Li, Sijia He, Baozheng Jiang, Shuai Wang, and Weixi Gu\nStability Category. The stability category focuses on an in-depth\nevaluation of LLMs along eight abilities across four categories: nu-\nmeric, grammatical, contextual, and others. Table 1 outlines the\neight abilities, providing their names and descriptions, as well as\nexamples of original texts and their equivalent variants. The nu-\nmeric category examines LLMs’ capability to handle numeric data,\nincluding changes in magnitude and precision. On the other hand,\nthe grammatical category, comprising the “Synonyms”, “Order”,\nand “Logic” abilities, evaluates LLMs’ ability to handle grammatical\nand semantic changes in questions. In contrast to the previous two\ncategories focused on token-level replacements, the context and\nother categories concentrate on sentence-level transformations. As\nthe name suggests, the context category assesses LLMs’ stability\nunder different contexts, including general and security-related con-\ntexts. Additionally, the sole ability in the others category handles\nthe inclusion of irrelevant content in questions.\nRobustness Definition. The robustness examined here refers to an\nLLM’s ability to maintain performance when facing input prompt\nvariations in industrial applications. Unlike accuracy evaluations\nwhich include open-ended questions as inputs, our robustness eval-\nuation only considers multiple-choice and true/false questions as\nthe original inputs, since open-ended questions are exceedingly\ndifficult to evaluate automatically without bias [ 96]. Robustness is\ndefined as the ratio of variants that share the same answer as the\nseed question, with a higher score indicating better robustness.\n4 IMPLEMENTATION AND SETUP\nTable 2: All LLMs in our consideration. “Deploy” denotes the\ndeployment mode of the LLMs. “Chosen ?” denotes whether\nthe LLMs are chosen for evaluation.\nModel Vendor Version Deploy Chosen ?\nGPT-4 [55] OpenAI gpt-4-0613 API !\nGPT-3.5 [54] OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 API !\nTongyi [10] Alibaba v1.0.5 API !\nErnie [5] Baidu v2.2.2 API !\nspark [11] Iflytek v2.0 API !\nChatGLM2 [89] ZHIPU 6b Local !\nMinimax [9] Minimax v5.5 API !\nTiangong [12] Kunlun v3.5.20230705.a WEB !\nCongrong [3] Cloudwalk v20230518 WEB !\n360ZhiNao [1] 360 v9.5 API !\nLlama2 [69] Meta AI 13b Local %\nClaude2 [2] Anthropic claude2 API %\nTested LLMs. As shown in Table 2, we evaluate a total of 12 LLMs,\nincluding 4 global LLMs and 8 local LLMs. The “Tiangong” and\n“Congrong” models are used through their respective web services\nto generate question answers, while other models are accessed\nthrough API services or locally deployed if source code is available.\nHowever, we exclude results from Llama2 and Claude2 in our pri-\nmary evaluation, as they perform unsatisfactorily with an accuracy\nrate of less than 0.1. Unfortunately, most vendors do not provide\ninformation on the number of parameters and the training dataset\nsize of each LLM, hence we could not provide such details in ourevaluation. Among all the LLMs, we only know that GPT-3.5 used\nto have 175 billion parameters, ChatGLM2 is a 6 billion parameters\nmodel, and llam2-13b is a 13 billion parameters model. Notably,\ncomparing the GPT series models with local LLMs may not be en-\ntirely fair, given the lack of clarity on these details. Nevertheless,\nsince the GPT models are considered state-of-the-art in the general\ndomain and the local LLMs are primarily designed for Chinese users,\nwe believe that the comparison still provides valuable insights into\nthe current state of LLMs in the industrial domain.\nDataset Statistics. The original dataset used in this study contains\n1,200 questions evenly divided across 8 industrial sectors, with each\nsector contributing 150 questions. As outlined in Sec. 3, our MT\nframework generates variants across four stability categories with\neight abilities. However, the number of generated variants varied\nfor each ability due to certain metamorphic relations being incom-\npatible with specific question formats. For instance, the “Order”\nrelation can not be applied to yes/no questions as they lack op-\ntions. Similarly, relations involving numerical value modification\ncan only be applied to questions containing numbers, which are not\nevenly distributed across sectors. This imbalance is retained to re-\nflect real-world conditions and the nature of the different industrial\nsectors.\nFinally, the variant dataset we use for robustness testing contains\na total of 13,631 questions, including 12,431 variants and 1,200\noriginal questions. Table 3 shows the number of variants generated\nfor each sector, where we see that the least number of variants\ngenerated for each sector is more than one thousand, which is\nsufficiently large to facilitate a thorough assessment of the LLMs’\nrobustness.\nTable 3: The statistics of variants generated for each sector.\n“# Variants” denotes the number of variants generated for\neach sector.\nIndustry # Variants Industry # Variants\nElectronic 1,479 Power 1,955\nEquipment 1,843 Petrochemical 1,060\nIron 1,377 Building 1,055\nMining 1,254 Textile 1,208\nExperiments Setup. During the experiments, we observe that\nLLMs can exhibit instability, as multiple attempts with the same\nprompt may produce diverse results. This is primarily due to the\ninherent randomness of the LLMs’ decoding process, in which\ntokens are sampled from a probability distribution over the vo-\ncabulary. While this stochasticity enhances response diversity in\nopen-domain conversation systems, consistency is crucial for in-\ndustrial applications. Consequently, we enforce determinism to\nguarantee replicable evaluations and facilitate reliable comparisons.\nTo minimize randomness and ensure reproducibility in our experi-\nments, we employ various methods. For cloud API-based models,\nwe assigned a value of 0 to the “temperature” hyper-parameter. In\nthe case of locally deployed models, we deactivate sampling during\ndecoding to achieve deterministic outcomes. However, controlling\nthe hyper-parameters of LLMs via a web service is unfeasible due\nto the absence of a suitable interface.

These sectors are se-\nlected due to their importance in industrial processes and ubiquity\nacross supply chains. Notably, the research focuses exclusively\non civilian industries and does not encompass any sectors\nrelated to national security or defense.\n2.2 Data Origin\nAs outlined in Sec. 1, the existing benchmarks for LLM evaluation\nare primarily relied on open-source datasets, which often consist of\nconversational logs or focus on common sense knowledge. However,\ngiven that the industrial chain operates as a closed-loop system, it\nmay be challenging to persuade stakeholders that the data indus-\ntrial sectors need is from open-ended conversations rather than\nwell-structured, formal, and professional documents. Therefore, we\ncollect the data from three real-world sources, as follows:\nNational Authoritative Question Set. It includes test ques-\ntions used in vocational re-education tests to check whether the\nexaminee has a strict grasp of the production norms of the relevant\nindustry.\nNational vocational and technical training guidelines. This\nmaterial is intended as a general guide for undergraduate and grad-\nuate students who intend to pursue a career in a related field.\nProduction and operation standardization conditions. For\ndifferent industries, corresponding functional government agencies\nhave issued relevant regulatory guidelines to ensure that industrial\nproduction is carried out in safe and controlled conditions, and this\npart of the material is more targeted and detailed than the previous\ntwo.\nWe notice that different countries have varying requirements\nand regulations that are dependent on their level of industrialization\nand local laws. Therefore, we claim that we only collect the data\nfrom the industrial sectors in China as this is the research scope of\nthis paper. However, we believe that our method can be applied toother countries, provided the data that is collected from qualified\nindustrial documents conforming to the local laws and regulations.\n2.3 Question Design\nIn this section, we first introduce the question formats used in this\nstudy, and then give the corresponding accuracy definitions.\nQuestion Format. After collecting a sufficient set of problems, we\norganize the data into formats appropriate for evaluating LLMs. Fol-\nlowing prior work like CMMLU [ 33], we primarily adopt multiple-\nchoice questions. Furthermore, we incorporate true/false questions\nsince many of the collected problems from our data source are in\nthis format. These formats have ground truth answers, making\nevaluation straightforward. As we mentioned in Sec. 1, existing\nLLM benchmarks also use open-domain conversational logs. Al-\nthough these open-ended questions are less prioritized in industrial\napplications, we still include them in our evaluation to provide a\ncomprehensive assessment of LLMs.\nAccuracy Definition. Following prior work [ 41], we use varying\ndefinitions of accuracy for different question formats. For the ques-\ntions that have ground truth answers, we calculate the accuracy\nby dividing the answers that are correct by the total number of all\ntested questions to evaluate the performance of the LLMs. On the\nother hand, for the open-ended question, we recruit twenty experts\nas participants.

How does the FORD framework use commonsense to handle inter-consistency issues among LLMs in debates?,"['Examining Inter-Consistency of Large Language Models Collaboration:\nAn In-depth Analysis via Debate\nKai Xiong1Xiao Ding1†Yixin Cao2†Ting Liu1Bing Qin1\n1Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval\nHarbin Institute of Technology, China\n2Singapore Management University, Singapore\n{kxiong, xding, tliu, qinb}@ir.hit.edu.cn\nyxcao@smu.edu.sg\nAbstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nimpressive capabilities in various applications,\nbut they still face various inconsistency issues.\nExisting works primarily focus on the incon-\nsistency issues within a single LLM, while we\ncomplementarily explore the inter-consistency\namong multiple LLMs for collaboration. To\nexamine whether LLMs can collaborate effec-\ntively to achieve a consensus for a shared goal,\nwe focus on commonsense reasoning, and in-\ntroduce a formal debate framework (FORD)\nto conduct a three-stage debate among LLMs\nwith real-world scenarios alignment: fair de-\nbate, mismatched debate, and roundtable de-\nbate. Through extensive experiments on var-\nious datasets, LLMs can effectively collabo-\nrate to reach a consensus despite noticeable\ninter-inconsistencies, but imbalances in their\nabilities can lead to domination by superior\nLLMs. Leveraging a more advanced LLM like\nGPT-4 as an authoritative judge can boost col-\nlaboration performance. Our work contributes\nto understanding the inter-consistency among\nLLMs and lays the foundation for develop-\ning future collaboration methods. Codes and\ndata are available at https://github.com/Waste-\nWood/FORD.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT re-\ncently demonstrate general intelligence (Bubeck\net al., 2023) and have been widely used as a foun-\ndation model in various applications (Wei et al.,\n2022b; Wu et al., 2023). To solve complex tasks,\nmultiple LLMs are further introduced to collab-\norate, with each targeting a different subtask or\naspect (Schick et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023). Inter-\nestingly, do these LLMs possess a spirit of collabo-\nration? Are they capable of cooperating effectively\nand performantly towards a shared goal?\nIn this paper, we dive into the inter-consistency\namong LLMs, complementary to existing work\n†Corresponding Authors\nQuestion: The ship wrecked.

Based on the observations, we highlight two\nmain inter-consistent concerns for LLMs’ collab-\noration. First, the viewpoints of LLMs are easily\nshifted. As shown in Figure 1 (a), the proponent\nand opponent LLMs are showing different predic-\ntions, while the proponent quickly compromises\nwith the answer of the opponent. To which extent\ndo LLMs easily change their viewpoints, or adhere\nto their perspectives? Second, when some LLMs\nremain steadfast in Figure 1 (b), can a consensus\nultimately be achieved for the shared goal?\nInspired by the debate theory (Mayer, 1997),\nwe devise a FormalDebate framework (FORD)\nto systematically and quantitatively investigate the\ninter-inconsistency issue in LLMs collaboration.\nBased on FORD, we allow LLMs to explore the\ndifferences between their own understandings and\nthe conceptualizations of others via debate (Mayer,\n1997). Thus, the results can not only shed light to\nencourage more diverse results, but also make it\npossible for performance gains by mutual learning.\nIn specific, we take multi-choice commonsense\nreasoning as the example task as it can accurately\nquantify the inter-inconsistency of LLMs collab-\noration. Then we formulate a three-stage debate\nto align with real-world scenarios: (1) Fair de-arXiv:2305.11595v3  [cs.CL]  18 Oct 2023', 'bate between two LLMs with comparable capa-\nbilities. (2) Mismatched debate between two\nLLMs who exhibit vastly different levels of abili-\nties. (3) Roundtable debate including more than\ntwo LLMs for debates. Besides, due to the leading\nperformance of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), we con-\nduct an in-depth analysis to adopt GPT-4 as a more\npowerful judge to summarize the debates and offer\nfinal conclusions. Note that FORD is flexible if\nstronger or more LLMs emerge.\nWe summarize our main findings as follows.\n(1) Different types of LLMs (e.g., chat and text\ncompletion models) have large inter-inconsistency,\neven if they are developed from the same base\nmodel. (2) For different versions of an LLM within\nthe same series (e.g., GPT-3.5), although their over-\nall performance keeps improving, the more ad-\nvanced models do not completely supersede the\ncapabilities of the early ones. (3) Through FORD,\nmultiple LLMs hold the potential to collaborate\nand reach a consensus, while the final results are\nnot always so desirable. (4) For LLMs with com-\nparable abilities, they can effectively and perfor-\nmantly achieve a shared goal. (5) On the other hand,\nfor LLMs with mismatched abilities, the superior\nLLMs are more likely to insist on their perspec-\ntives and dominate the debate, while weaker ones\nare more likely to compromise and change their\nviewpoints. (6) Nevertheless, the stubborn and less\ncapable LLMs may distract the superior ones and\nlower the overall performance.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n•We systematically and quantitatively study the\ninter-consistency among two and more LLMs.\n•We adopt debate theory and design a formal\ndebate framework FORD towards quantitative\nanalysis and LLMs collaboration.\n•We design a three-stage debate and have con-\nducted extensive experiments to offer insights\nfor future research.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe first describe the datasets and LLMs used in\nthis paper.

How do in-context exemplars affect LLMs in low-resource multilingual translation vs. NLLB and Google Translate?,"['LLM may struggle to acquire helpful translation\nknowledge from semantically-related exemplars.\nExemplars teach LLM the core feature of trans-\nlation task To better understand how ICL exem-\nplars influence LLM to understand the translation\ntask, we observe LLM’s translation behaviour un-\nder abnormal in-context exemplars (Table 4).\nWe can see that LLM completely fails when\nmismatched translation is used as exemplars, indi-\ncating that LLM needs to learn from the context to\nkeep source and target sentence semantically con-\nsistent. Word-level15and document-level16transla-\ntion exemplar degenerates LLM’s translation per-\nformance, which demonstrates that the translation\ngranularity of exemplar matters as well. Another in-\nteresting phenomenon is that LLM performs worse\nwhen duplicated translation is used as the exem-\nplar, indicating that keeping in-context exemplars\ndiverse is also important. In general, these compar-\nison results show that LLM learns the core feature\nof translation task through in-context learning.\nThe exemplar in the tail of the prompt has more\nimpact on the LLM’s behaviour During our\nanalysis, we find that reversing the translation direc-\ntion of exemplars will cause LLM to fail. Based on\nthis observation, we conduct experiments to investi-\ngate the importance of different parts of the prompt\n(Table 5). We find that reversing exemplars in the\ntail of the prompt consistently produced worse re-\nsults compared to reversing exemplars in the head,\nwhich suggests that exemplars in the tail of the\nprompt have larger influence on LLM’s behavior.\n6 Related Work\nIn-context learning for machine translation\nUsing LLMs for multilingual machine translation is\nattracting more and more attention.

In this paper, we thoroughly evalu-\nate multilingual translation performance of popular\nLLMs on 102 languages and 606 directions and\ncompare them with state-of-the-art translation en-\ngines, such as NLLB and Google Translate, which\nprovides a more comprehensive benchmark result\n15We select word pairs from open-source fasttext dictionary.\n16We select document translation from Europarl dataset.and highlights the challenges involved in optimiz-\ning this emerging translation paradigm.\nTo find better ICL recipe for machine transla-\ntion, many efforts have been put into designing\nexemplars selection strategy (Agrawal et al., 2022;\nZhang et al., 2023; Moslem et al., 2023). Similar\nto the findings of Zhang et al. (2023), we find that\nrandom selection is a simple but effective strategy.\nWe also find that even oracle selection can not re-\nsult in consistently better performance. Wei et al.\n(2022a) shows few-shot exemplars improve trans-\nlation performance. But we further demonstrate\nthe dynamic variations of translation performance\nwith the number of in-context exemplars and the\nusage of cross-lingual exemplars. Besides, Vilar\net al. (2022) find that using a high-quality pool,\ne.g., development set, for ICL example selection\nis better and Zhang et al. (2023) analyze why the\nquality of translation exemplars matters. In this\npaper, we reveal how in-context exemplars teach\nLLM to translate by analyzing LLM’s behaviour\nunder different kinds of exemplars.\nMultilingual machine translation Developing\na bilingual translation system for each direction be-\ncomes impossible when the number of supporting\nlanguages increases. Therefore, multilingual ma-\nchine translation is proposed (Johnson et al., 2017).\nBut how to build a high-quality yet efficient MMT\nsystem remains an on-going challenge (Costa-jussà\net al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al.,\n2023). In this paper, we focus on LLM and reveal\nits potential in MMT.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we evaluate the multilingual transla-\ntion ability of popular LLMs, including ChatGPT\nand GPT-4, on 102 languages and 606 directions,\nwhich presents the advantages and challenges of\nLLMs for MMT. We find that translation capabili-\nties of LLMs are continually improving and GPT-\n4 reaches new performance height. But even for\nGPT-4, it still face challenge on low-resource lan-\nguages. In our analysis, we find that LLMs ex-\nhibit new working patterns when used for MMT.\nFor example, instruction semantics can be ignored\nduring in-context learning and cross-lingual exem-\nplars can provide better task instruction for low-\nresource translation. More importantly, we find that\nLLM can acquire translation ability in a resource-\nefficient way, which indicates the promising future\nof LLM in multilingual machine translation.', 'tions (202 English-centric directions, 202 French-\ncentric directions and 202 Chinese-centric direc-\ntions). Results show that the multilingual transla-\ntion capabilities of LLMs are continually improv-\ning and GPT-4 reaches new performance height.\nCompared with the widely-used supervised MMT\nsystem NLLB (Costa-jussà et al., 2022), GPT-4\nachieves higher performance on 40.91% English-\ncentric translation directions. But compared with\nthe commercial translation system (Google Trans-\nlator), LLMs still have a long way to go, partic-\nularly when it comes to low-resource languages.\nFrench-centric and Chinese-centric translation are\nmore challenging for GPT-4 than English-centric\ntranslation, which further indicates its unbalanced\ncapability across languages.\nFor the second question, we find some new work-\ning patterns. First, LLMs are able to perform trans-\nlation even with unreasonable instructions if in-\ncontext learning exemplars are given. However, if\ngiven mismatched translation pairs as in-context\nexemplars, LLMs fail to translate, which is similar\nto observations from concurrent studies (Wei et al.,\n2023). This shows the importance of exemplars in\nICL for machine translation. Second, we find that\ncross-lingual translation pairs can be surprisingly\ngood exemplars for low-resource translation, even\nbetter than exemplars in the same language. Third,\nwe discover that LLM can acquire translation abil-\nity in a resource-efficient way and generate moder-\nate translation even on zero-resource languages.\nThe main contribution of this paper can be sum-\nmarized below:\n•We benchmark popular LLMs on MMT in\n102 languages and 606 translation directions,\ncovering English-centric, French-centric and\nChinese-centric translation.\n•We systematically compare the results of\nLLMs and three strong supervised base-\nlines (M2M-100, NLLB, Google Translator)\nand reveal the gap between two translation\nparadigms.\n•We find some new ICL working patterns of\nLLMs for MMT and discuss corresponding\nadvantages and challenges.\n2 Background\n2.1 Large Language Models\nLanguage modeling is a long-standing task in nat-\nural language processing (Bengio et al., 2000;Mikolov et al., 2010; Khandelwal et al., 2020),\nwhich is a task to predict the probability of the\nnext token. Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017)\nbasically is the backbone of existing LLMs.\nLLMs show great potential as a universal multi-\ntask learner. Recently, Radford et al. (2019) find\nthat a casual decoder-only language model can be a\nmulti-task learner with merely unsupervised train-\ning corpus. Later, Kaplan et al. (2020) reveal the\nscaling law of LLM, indicating that when the scale\nof neural parameters and training data keeps in-\ncreasing, LLM can be further strengthened. Wei\net al. (2022b) show that scaling the language model\nalso brings astonishing emergent abilities , e.g., in-\ncontext learning, which is only present in large\nmodels. Consequently, more and more efforts have\nbeen put into scaling-up language models (Brown\net al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Scao et al.,\n2022; Vilar et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2023). Among\nthem, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and ChatGPT (Ope-\nnAI, 2022) are the most representative systems,\nwhich shows impressive results in various NLP\ntasks.\n2.2 Emergent Ability: In-context Learning\nIn-context learning is one of the well-known emer-\ngent abilities (Brown et al., 2020; Dong et al.,\n2022), which enables LLM to learn target tasks\naccording to the prompt without updating any pa-\nrameters.\nSpecifically, the prompt is made up of in-context\nexemplars {(Xi,Yi)}k\ni=1and in-context template\nT. Exemplars are often picked from supervised\ndata, where Yiis the ground truth corresponding\nto the input sentence Xi. Template Tis usually a\nhuman-written instruction related to the target task.\nWrapping exemplars with the template and concate-\nnating them together produce the final prompt:\nP=T(X1,Y1)⊕ T(X2,Y2)⊕ ··· ⊕ T (Xk,Yk)\nwhere ⊕denotes the concatenation symbol, e.g.,\nwhitespace, line-break. During inference, LLM is\nable to generate the corresponding output Yof the\ntest sample Xunder the guidance of the prompt:\narg max\nYp(P ⊕ T (X,Y)) (1)\nFor label prediction tasks, the prediction Ycan\nbe obtained in one-step generation. For sequence\ngeneration tasks, e.g., machine translation, the pre-\ndiction Ycan be obtained through sampling strate-\ngies like greedy search and beam search.']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '2304.04675v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2304.04675v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 8467017, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2304.04675v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2304.04675v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 8467017, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
"How do org roles, model cards, and datasheets boost LLM accountability and transparency to reduce ethical risks?","['2.Creating an audit trail of the LLM development process to provide chronological documentary evidence of the\ndevelopment of an LLM’s capabilities, including information about its intended purpose, design specifications\nand choices, as well as training data and testing procedures through the generation of model cards [82],\ndatasheets [83] and system cards [84].20Audit trails serve several related purposes. Stipulating design\nspecifications upfront facilitates checking system adherence to jurisdictional requirements downstream [169].\nSimilarly, information concerning intended use cases should inform licensing agreements with downstream\ndevelopers [176], thereby restricting the potential for harm through misuse. Finally, requiring providers to\ndocument and justify their design choices sparks ethical deliberation by making trade-offs explicit.\n3.Mapping roles and responsibilities within organisations that design LLMs facilitates the allocation of ac-\ncountability for system failures. LLMs’ adaptability downstream does not exculpate technology providers\nfrom all responsibility. Some risks are ‘reasonably foreseeable’. In the adjacent field of machine learning\n(ML) image recognition, a study found that commercial gender classification systems were less accurate\nfor darker-skinned females than lighter-skin males [177]. After the release of these findings, all technology\nproviders speedily improved the accuracy of their models, suggesting that the main problem was intrinsic, but\nresulted from inadequate risk management. Mapping the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders\nimproves accountability and increases the likelihood of impact assessments being structured rather than ad-hoc,\nthus helping identify and mitigate harms proactively.\nTo conduct these three tasks, auditors primarily require what Koshiyama et al. [11] refer to as white-box auditing.\nThis is the highest level of access and suggests that the auditor knows how and why an LLM was developed. In practice,\nit implies privileged access to facilities, documentation, and personnel, which is standard practice in governance audits\nin other fields. For example, IT auditors have full access to material and reports related to operational processes and\nperformance metrics [93]. It also implies access to the input data, learning procedures, and task objectives used to train\nLLMs. White-box auditing requires that nondisclosure and data-sharing agreements are in place, which adds to the\nlogistical burden of governance audits. However, granting such a high level of access is especially important from an\nAI safety perspective because, in addition to auditing LLMs before market deployment, governance audits should also\nevaluate organisational safeguards concerning high-risk projects that providers may prefer not to discuss publicly.\nThe results of governance audits should be provided in formats tailored to different audiences. The primary\naudience is the management and directors of the LLM provider. Auditors should provide a full report that directly and\ntransparently lists and discusses the vulnerabilities of existing governance structures. Such reports may recommend\nactions, but taking actions remains the provider’s responsibility. Usually, such audit reports are not made public.\nHowever, some evidence obtained during governance audits can be curated for two secondary audiences: law enforcers\nand developers of downstream applications. In some jurisdictions, hard legislation may demand that technology\nproviders follow specific requirements. For instance, the proposed EU AI Act required providers to register high-risk\nAI systems with a centralised database [54] or implement a risk management system [178]. In such cases, reports from\nindependent governance audits can help providers demonstrate adherence to legislation. Reports from governance\naudits also assist developers of downstream applications to understand an LLM’s intended purpose, testing, verification,\nrisks, and limitations.\nBefore concluding this discussion, it is useful to reflect on how governance audits contribute to relieving some\nof the social and ethical risks LLMs pose. As mentioned in Sec 2, Weidinger et al. [39] listed six broad risk areas:\ndiscrimination, information hazards, misinformation hazards, malicious use, human-computer interaction harm, and\nautomation and environmental harms. Governance audits address some of these directly. By assessing the adequacy of\nthe governance structures surrounding LLMs, including licencing agreements [176] and structured access protocols [76],\ngovernance audits help reduce the risk of malicious use. Further, some information hazards stem from the possibility of\nextracting sensitive information from LLMs via adversarial attacks [179]. By reviewing the process whereby training\ndatasets were sourced, labelled, and curated, as well as the strategies and techniques used during the model training\nprocess – such as differential privacy [180] or secure federated learning [181] – governance audits can minimise the risk\nof LLMs leaking sensitive information. However, for most of the risk areas listed by Weidinger et al. [39], governance\naudits have only an indirect impact insofar as they contribute to transparency about the limitations and intended purposes\nof LLMs. Hence, risks areas like discrimination, misinformation hazards, and human-computer interaction harms are\nbetter addressed by model and application audits.\n4.3 Model audits\nBefore deployment, LLMs should be subject to model audits that assess their capabilities and limitations (Claim 6).\nModel audits share some features with governance audits. For example, both happen before an LLM is adapted for\n20Meta AI’s detailed notes on the OPT model provide an exemplar of model training documentation [175].\n12', 'reasons, analysing LLMs from ethical perspectives requires innovation in risk assessment tools, benchmarks, and\nframeworks [77].\nSeveral governance mechanisms designed to ensure that LLMs are legal, ethical, and safe have been proposed or\npiloted [78]. Some are technically oriented, including the pre-processing of the initial training data, the fine-tuning of\nLLMs on data with desired properties, and procedures to test the model at scale pre-deployment [53], [77]. Others\nseek to address the ethical and social risks associated with LLMs through sociotechnical mitigation strategies, e.g.,\ncreating more diverse developer teams [79], human-in-the-loop protocols [80] and qualitative evaluation tools based\non ethnographic methods [81]. Yet others seek to ensure transparency in AI development processes, e.g., through a\nstructured use of model cards [82], datasheets [83], system cards [84], and the watermarking of system outputs [85].9\nTo summarise, while LLMs have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, they also pose\nsignificant ethical and social risks. Therefore, the question of how LLMs should be governed has attracted much\nattention, with proposals ranging from structured access protocols designed to prevent malicious use [76] to hard\nregulation prohibiting the deployment of LLMs for specific purposes [86]. However, the effectiveness and feasibility\nof these governance mechanisms have yet to be substantiated by empirical research. Moreover, given the multiplicity\nand complexity of the ethical and social risks associated with LLMs, we anticipate that policy responses will need to\nbe multifaceted and incorporate several complementary governance mechanisms. As of now, technology providers\nand policymakers have only started experimenting with different governance mechanisms, and how LLMs should be\ngoverned remains an open question [87].\n2.3 Call for Audits\nAgainst the backdrop of the technological and regulatory landscape surveyed in this section, auditing should be\nunderstood as one of several governance mechanisms different stakeholders can employ to ensure and demonstrate that\nLLMs are legal, ethical, and technically robust. It is important to stress that auditing LLMs is not a hypothetical idea\nbut a tangible policy option that has been proposed by researchers, technology providers, and policymakers alike. For\ninstance, when coining the term foundation models, Bommasani et al. [18] also suggested that ‘such models should be\nsubject to rigorous testing and auditing procedures’. Moreover, in an open letter concerning the risks associated with\nLLMs and other foundation models, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman stated that ‘it’s important that efforts like ours submit\nto independent audits before releasing new systems’ [88]. Finally, the European Commission is considering classifying\nLLMs and other foundation models as ‘high-risk AI systems’ [89].10This would imply that technology providers\ndesigning LLMs have to undergo ‘conformity assessments with the involvement of an independent third-party’, i.e.,\naudits by another name [91].\nDespite widespread calls for LLM auditing, central questions concerning how LLMs can and should be audited\nhave yet to be explored by academic researchers. This article addresses that gap by outlining a procedure for auditing\nLLMs. The main argument we advance can be summarised as follows. What auditing means varies between different\nacademic disciplines and industry contexts [92]. However, three strands of auditing research and practice are particularly\nrelevant with respect to ensuring good governance of LLMs. The first stems from IT audits, whereby auditors assess\nthe adequacy of technology providers’ software development processes and quality management procedures [93].\nThe second strand stems from model testing and verification within the computer sciences, whereby auditors assess\nthe properties of different computational models [94]. The third strand stems from product certification procedures,\nwhereby auditors test consumer goods for legal compliance and technical safety before they go to market [95]. As we\nargue throughout this paper, it is necessary to combine auditing tools and procedural best practices from each of these\nthree strands to identify and manage the social and ethical risks LLMs pose. Therefore, our blueprint for auditing LLMs\ncombines governance audits of technology providers, model audits of LLMs, and application audits of downstream\nproducts and services built on top of LLMs. The details of this ‘three-layered approach’ are outlined in Sec. 4.\n2.4 Addressing initial objections\nBefore proceeding any further, it is useful to consider some reasonable objections to the prospect of auditing LLMs\n- as well as potential responses to these objections. First, one may argue that there is no need to audit LLMs per se\nand that auditing procedures should be established at the application level instead. Although audits on the application\nlevel are important, the objection presents a false dichotomy: quality and accountability mechanisms can and should be\nestablished at different stages of supply chains. Moreover, while some risks can only be addressed at the application\nlevel, others are best managed upstream. It is true that many factors, including some beyond the technology provider’s\n9A watermark is a hidden pattern in a text that is imperceptible to humans but makes it algorithmically identifiable as synthetic.\n10It is still uncertain how the EU AIA should be interpreted with respect to LLMs. The current formulation states that models that\nmay be used for high-risk applications should be considered high-risk [90].\n5']","Organizational roles, model cards, and datasheets boost LLM accountability and transparency by mapping roles and responsibilities within organizations, creating an audit trail of the LLM development process, and documenting and justifying design choices.

"How does code data at different training stages affect LLM reasoning, given eval challenges with varying parameters and data scales?","['Under review, arXiv pre-print\nand specific origin of this mixed-code data is unclear. Some researchers have extensively analyzed\nthe performance of current LLM on various tasks, pointing out that code may be the key to improving\nreasoning ability (Liang et al., 2022; Fu et al., 2022). However, the evaluated models have different\nparameters and data scales, and problems such as unknown training details exist. It is difficult to\ndetermine the exact impact of code data on the reasoning ability of LLMs.\n5 C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate at which stage introducing code data can help improve the reasoning\nability of LLMs. We validate the effect of code data at different stages with the same parameter scale\nand using the same training objective. We point out that simply adding code data in the pre-training\nphase can effectively improve the general reasoning ability of the model. Furthermore, we find that\nadding code instructions in the instruction tuning stage can make the model follow human instructions\nfor output and improve specific code reasoning capabilities.

Inspired by the great success\nof code data in training LLMs, we naturally wonder at which training stage introduc-\ning code data can really help LLMs reasoning. To this end, this paper systematically\nexplores the impact of code data on LLMs at different stages. Concretely, we in-\ntroduce the code data at the pre-training stage, instruction-tuning stage, and both\nof them, respectively. Then, the reasoning capability of LLMs is comprehensively\nand fairly evaluated via six reasoning tasks in five domains. We critically analyze\nthe experimental results and provide conclusions with insights. First, pre-training\nLLMs with the mixture of code and text can significantly enhance LLMs’ general\nreasoning capability almost without negative transfer on other tasks. Besides, at the\ninstruction-tuning stage, code data endows LLMs the task-specific reasoning capa-\nbility. Moreover, the dynamic mixing strategy of code and text data assists LLMs to\nlearn reasoning capability step-by-step during training.

"How do ""chain-of-thought"" and ""graph description language"" together boost LLM reasoning?","['THEME/FEATURE/DEPARTMENT\ntheir performance lags behind that of graph neural net-\nwork benchmarks. They also show that performance of\nLLMs is significantly affected by the prompting strategy\nand the use of graph description language, which is a\ntextual way to describe graphs.\nA more advanced method, dubbed InstructGLM,\nhas been put forth8. This strategy utilises a multi-\ntask, multi-prompt instructional tuning process to refine\nLLMs prior to inference on specific tasks. During fine-\ntuning, nodes are treated as new tokens—initialised\nwith inherent node features—to broaden the original\nvocabulary of LLMs. Consequently, node embeddings\ncan be refined during the training phase. Employing\nthis refined methodology, their system outperforms\ngraph neural network benchmarks across three citation\nnetworks.\nLLMs Constructing Graphs\nLLMs can help in building graphs for downstream\ntasks as shown in Figure 1(c). For instance, some\nresearchers have tried using LLMs to analyse news\nheadlines and identify companies that might be\nimpacted10. In specific, a network of companies that\nhave correlations is constructed by LLMs automati-\ncally. The generated network can be used to improve\nthe performance of predictions of stock market move-\nments.\nGraphs Enhance LLM Ability\nLeveraging graph structures can significantly boost the\nreasoning and collaborative capacities of LLMs. As\nshown in the right part of Figure 1, these improvements\nemerge via two primary mechanisms: (1) employing\ngraph structures to bolster logical reasoning in LLMs,\nand (2) utilizing graph structures to enhance LLM\ncollaboration in multi-agent systems. We delve deeper\ninto each of these approaches in the subsequent sec-\ntions.\nGraphs Improving LLMs Reasoning\nGraphs are the foundational structure of human rea-\nsoning. Through tools like mind maps and flowcharts,\nand strategies like trial and error or task decomposi-\ntion, we manifest our intrinsic graph-structured thought\nprocesses. Not surprisingly, when properly leveraged,\nthey can significantly elevate the reasoning capabilities\nof LLMs. As illustrated in Figure 1(d1), when tasked,\nLLMs follow a sequence: they process the input data,\nengage in reasoning, and then produce the final re-\nsults. Figure 1(d2) highlights the limitations of LLMs us-\ning “Input-output Prompting”; without reasoning, theirperformance tends to suffer, especially with complex\ntasks.\nEmploying graph structures, from basic chains and\ntrees to more complex designs, can profoundly aug-\nment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Consider the\n“chain-of-thought prompting” (COT) method, depicted\nin Figure 1(d3)4. In this, LLMs harness a chain, a\ntype of directed acyclic graph, for structured problem-\nsolving. Remarkably, even this basic framework triples\nLLMs’ efficacy on GSM8K, a math word problem\nbenchmark.\nIn contrast, the “Tree of Thoughts” (ToT) method,\nutilising trees—an elementary undirected acyclic\ngraph—delves deeper into reasoning. Eeach reason-\ning phase in ToT is a node7. LLMs traverse this\ntree, eliminating non-compliant nodes and returning\nupwards as necessary, to deduce the solution. With\nthis methodology, LLMs notch up a 74% accuracy in\nthe “Game of 24” test, overshadowing the 4% from\nCOT7.\nDiving into intricate graph structures propels LLMs’\ncapabilities even further. Improving ToT, the “Graph\nof Thoughts” (GoT) paradigm has been introduced1,2,\nas illustrated in Figure 1(d5). This advanced rea-\nsoning graph can be heterogeneous, with diverse\nnodes dedicated to specific tasks. Sophisticated mech-\nanisms, such as node aggregation and combination\n(A&C), and dynamic interactions between paths and\ngraphs, are incorporated. A&C, for instance, facilitates\nnode subdivision for task decomposition and node\namalgamation1. Path interactions offer LLMs greater\nflexibility by enabling cross-path traversals, a leap from\nToT’s isolated branch framework. Multi-graph interac-\ntions can even be orchestrated for intricate tasks2.\nThese GoT methodologies dramatically outpace sim-\npler graph models in handling complex challenges,\nindicating that more intricate graph structures could\nusher in even more significant enhancements.\nGraphs Building LLMs Collaboration\nWhile the preceding section examined the capabilities\nof individual LLMs, complex tasks, such as software\ndevelopment, require multiple LLMs to work in tandem\nwithin a collaborative framework, i.e., multi-agent sys-\ntems, as illustrated in Figure 1(e). Graph structures can\nbe instrumental in this context. As depicted in the same\nfigure, these structures can effectively model the rela-\ntionships and information flow between collaborating\nLLMs.\nOct 2023 Integrating Graphs with Large Language Models: Methods and Prospects 3', 'THEME/FEATURE/DEPARTMENT\nLLM\nText Enhanced\nAttributeGraph Learning \nModels\n(a) LLMs Augmenting Graph Algorithms\n(c) LLMs Constructing Graphs\nLLM\nGraphs(b) LLMs Predicting Graph Tasks\nLLM\nGraphs\nAnalysePrediction\nDirect    is predicted as A\nPredict with \nExplanation   \'s 1-hop neighbors \nis ......

This gives rise to\nthe anticipation that leveraging more intricate graph\nstructures could usher in even more profound im-\nprovements. From a broader viewpoint, in multi-agent\nsystems, graphs model inter-agent relationships, facil-\nitating efficient information flow and collaboration.\nLLMs Enhance Graph Learning\nOne pivotal approach to integrating LLMs and graphs\ninvolves leveraging LLMs to bolster graph learning.\nAs illustrated in the left part of Figure 1, this en-\nhancement can materialise through three distinct path-\nways: augmenting conventional graph algorithms with\nthe prowess of LLMs; directly employing LLMs for\ndownstream graph-related tasks; and utilizing LLMs in\nthe intricate construction of graph structures. In the\nfollowing sections, we dissect each of these strategies\nin detail.\nLLMs Augmenting Graph Algorithms\nThe integration of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith graph algorithms primarily seeks to harness LLMs\nas attribute-enhancement mechanisms, elevating the\nintrinsic attributes of graph nodes. As depicted in\nFigure 1(a), LLMs process text information for nodesto produce refined attributes. These enhanced at-\ntributes can potentially improve the performance of\ngraph learning models such as graph neural networks\n(GNNs).\nA direct approach is to employ LLMs as encoders\nfor processing node text-based attributes, with the\noption to fine-tune on specific downstream tasks3.\nAnother technique uses a proprietary LLM, GPT -3.5, to\nsimultaneously produce predictions and explanations\nfor tasks like paper classification5. Using another open-\nsource LLM, they derive node embeddings by encod-\ning both the output of LLMs and the original attributes.\nThese embeddings are combined and then integrated\ninto GNNs to boost performance.\nA more sophisticated approach uses an iterative\nmethod to harmoniously integrate both GNNs and\nLLMs capabilities3. They are initially trained sepa-\nrately; then, via a variational EM framework, the LLM\nuses text and GNN’s pseudo labels, while the GNN\nutilizes LLM-encoded embeddings or node attributes\nand LLMs’ pseudo labels, iteratively boosting mutual\nperformance.\nLLMs Predicting Graph Tasks\nLLMs are adept at predicting graph properties, includ-\ning attributes like node degrees and connectivity, and\ncan even tackle complex challenges such as node and\ngraph classification, as illustrated in Figure 1(b).\nA straightforward application involves presenting\nLLMs with zero-shot or few-shot prompts, prompting\nthem to either directly predict an outcome or to first\nprovide an analytical rationale followed by the ulti-\nmate prediction3,6.

How does ChatDB's SQL ops and symbolic memory boost its performance in managing/querying extensive fruit shop records?,"['ChatDB\nTable 2: The experimental results of answering questions in the Fruit Shop Dataset. There are 50 questions in total,\nwith 15 being easy questions and 35 being hard questions.\nModel Easy Hard All Accuracy\nChatGPT 10/15 1/35 11/50 22%\nChatDB (ours) 13/15 28/35 41/50 82%\ntransactions, leading to errors in its answering process. This issue is commonly encountered and evident in all these\nexamples. Furthermore, ChatGPT tends to make sequential errors, resulting in significant error accumulation.\nIn contrast, ChatDB performs quite well in these examples. During the initial processing of records, symbolic operations\n(i.e., SQL operations) are applied to manipulate the database ( i.e., symbolic memory), ensuring that all information is\nstored in a structured form within the database. When answering questions, ChatDB generates SQL statements to query\nthe database. The three examples demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatDB in solving problems requiring one, two,\nand three chain-of-memory steps, respectively. We can observe that ChatDB accurately answers the questions, and the\nexecution logic of the chain-of-memory is clear, with each step tightly connected and approaching the ultimate answer.\nFrom these examples, the advantages of ChatDB are evident in two aspects:\n1. Through the chain-of-memory approach, complex problems are decomposed into multiple steps of memory operations,\nsimplifying the problem’s complexity. Each step’s result is accurately stored as an intermediate outcome and used in\nsubsequent steps, which greatly assists in complex reasoning.\n2. Symbolic memory enables precise operations and calculations. ChatDB delegates many calculational tasks to the\nexternal database by executing SQL statements, ensuring the accuracy of each step and preventing error accumulation.\nIn summary, by leveraging external databases as symbolic memory, ChatDB significantly outperforms ChatGPT in this\nexperiment.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce ChatDB, a framework that augments LLMs with symbolic memory in the form of databases.\nWe demonstrate the advantages and capabilities of symbolic memory and chain-of-memory approach in enhancing\ncomplex reasoning and preventing error accumulation. By providing a precise storage mechanism for intermediate\nresults, symbolic memory enables accurate and reliable operations. Moreover, the use of symbolic languages, such\nas SQL, allows symbolic computation and manipulation of stored information. Through experimental evaluation, we\nobserve a significant improvement in performance with ChatDB compared to ChatGPT. The integration of symbolic\nmemory in ChatDB substantially enhances the model’s ability to handle various queries and reasoning tasks in\nmanagement settings.

Given the history records for the fruit shop in January 2023, which\ninclude customer names, transaction dates, fruit prices, quantities purchased, and whether the items were returned, you\nneed to answer some questions.\nBy default, exclude the sales transactions that have been returned when performing calculations.\nHere are the historical records of the fruit shop, which are arranged in chronological order based on the occurrence\ntime, surrounded by triple backticks:\n```\n{records}\n```\nBased on the history records, answer the question about the fruit shop:\n{question}\nFigure 4: Prompt for ChatGPT to answer questions in the Fruit Shop Dataset. The placeholders “records” and “question”\nwill be replaced by specific details when it is actually used.\nWhy do we limit the token length of the dataset? If the token length of the dataset exceeds the maximum token\nlength of ChatGPT, memory becomes necessary. However, the mainstream memory retrieval methods based on vector\nembedding are prone to errors. This inevitably leads to a decline in the performance of ChatGPT, which is not desired.\nTherefore, we deliberately design the token length of the dataset to be within the maximum token length of ChatGPT to\navoid using memory and maximize the model’s performance. Note that ChatDB’s performance is generally unaffected\nby the token length of the dataset. Thus, if ChatDB outperforms ChatGPT when the dataset is small, it indicates that\nChatDB is also superior to memory-augmented ChatGPT when the dataset is large.\n4.1.3 Processing records\nFor ChatDB, the first step is to initialize the database. We need to generate a reasonable database schema for the specific\ntask scenario and create tables in the database. The generation of the database schema can be done manually or using\nLLMs. Next, for each record in the dataset, ChatDB processes them one by one. Using the LLM controller, ChatDB\nmanipulates the external database ( i.e., symbolic memory) following Algorithm 1. We provide examples of ChatDB’s\nresponse to the four common operations in the Fruit Shop Dataset, namely purchasing, selling, changing prices, and\ngoods returns, as shown in Figure 3. It is worth emphasizing that ChatDB processes record one by one, so it is not\nsensitive to the total number of records. Furthermore, each step of the database operation in ChatDB is symbolic and\nfree from errors. Therefore, in theory, ChatDB can handle an infinite number of historical records without sacrificing\nperformance. However, for ChatGPT or existing memory-augmented LLMs, excessively long historical records can\nsignificantly degrade performance. In this experiment, as for the ChatGPT baseline, since the records are not long, we\nsimply treat them as part of the prompt.\n4.1.4 Answering questions\nWhen answering questions, ChatDB no longer requires records to be part of the prompt. After processing the records,\nthe information is stored in symbolic memory. Following Algorithm 1, ChatDB utilizes SQL statements to perform a\nseries of database queries (including calculations) in order to answer the question. On the other hand, ChatGPT includes\nrecords as part of the prompt and directly asks the question. The prompt template is shown in Figure 4.\n4.2 Results\nThe experimental results are presented in Table 2, which clearly demonstrate that ChatDB outperforms ChatGPT with\nsignificantly higher accuracy. While ChatGPT is capable of answering easy questions, it falls short in handling hard\nquestions that necessitate multi-hop reasoning and precise calculations. Consequently, ChatGPT exhibits a low accuracy\nrate for these hard questions. In contrast, ChatDB exhibits a notably high accuracy rate, underscoring the advantages of\nutilizing a database as symbolic memory. This approach not only prevents error accumulation but also enhances the\nmulti-hop reasoning and precise calculation capabilities of LLMs.\nWe present several examples of the two models answering questions in Figure 5 for comparison. In all these examples,\nChatDB correctly answers the questions while ChatGPT fails. ChatGPT often exhibits errors in calculating the total\nprice of each sale transaction, as observed in Figure 5(a).

The light gray boxes display the ground truth of the given problems, while the results given\nby the SMT solver are presented in the dark grey boxes. ‘UNK’ denotes unknown.\nhave been left unexplored by prior studies. While previous\nworks have predominantly focused on directly solving logic\nproblems presented in natural language (NL) form or employ-\ning external logical solvers, Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave primarily served as NL reasoners or NL-SL translators\nin those endeavors. Given that LLMs have been extensively\nutilized for logic reasoning in NL, it prompts the question:\nWhat about code simulation? As logic is always inherently\nimplicit within code and is manifested through the code’s\nexecution, it serves as a fundamental component that guides\nthe analysis process and influences the identification of defects,\nverification of correctness properties, and generation of test\ncases. To solve logic problems encoded within it, LLMs\nmust comprehend implicit logic, engage in logic reasoning,\nand translate the results of reasoning back into the code’s\nexecution outcome, which constitutes the entire process of\nLLMs’ simulation of logic codes.\nThus, our study delves into the realm of LLMs’ simulation\nof logic codes to ascertain whether LLMs can retain their\nproficiency in logic reasoning when applied to code as LLM-\nbased logical solvers. To distinguish our work from others, we\npropose the first research question: (RQ1) Can LLMs efficiently\nsimulate the outputs of logic codes? Through experiments,\nwe demonstrate LLMs’ competence in inferring the outcomes\nof codes that incorporate logical reasoning. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of various prompt techniques,\nsuch as PS, CoSm, and COT, in enhancing LLMs’ perfor-\nmance in simulating code. To fully harness the potential of\nLLMs in logic code simulation, we introduce our framework,\nDual Chains of Logic (DCoL), which stands as the first\nframework specifically tailored for LLM-based logic solvers.\nDCoL takes the code directly as input and guides LLMs to\nadopt a dual-path thinking approach, enabling them to draw\nconclusions for the code’s result. This framework assists LLMsin effectively navigating through reasoning traps, such as\nmultiple assignment problems, and reducing confusion during\nlogic problem-solving. Then, we raise the rest of our research\nquestions: (RQ2) What strength and (RQ3) pitfalls arise along\nwith logic code simulation? To this end, we conduct a thor-\nough examination of the effectiveness, strengths, and potential\npitfalls of LLM-based logic solvers, offering a comprehensive\nanalysis of their performance and identifying potential aspects\nfor refinement and enhancement in the future.\nWe highlight our contributions as follows:\n•We are the first to propose a novel task, logic code\nsimulation, for accessing LLMs’ capability of directly\nsolving logic problems encoded in programs with model\ninference.\n•We collect three new datasets for the logic code simula-\ntion task. We also conduct comprehensive evaluations on\ndifferent LLMs.\n•We propose a novel LLM-based code simulation tech-\nnique, DCoL, resulting in a notable improvement in\naccuracy by 7.06% with GPT-4-Turbo.\nII. B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nA. Large Language Model\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are generative models\nbased on the pre-trained Transformer architecture. Most LLMs\nutilize a generative model architecture, where given a sentence\nofntokens, the model is trained to maximize the likelihood\nof the ground-truth token tiat the current time step tbased\non its preceding sequence ti−1, ..., t 1. The training of LLMs\ntypically follows three main processes: unsupervised training\non large amounts of unlabeled text data without explicit human\nannotations, supervised fine-tuning on labeled data relevant\nto specific tasks or domains, and reinforcement learning on\nfeedback from human annotators or evaluators. Leveraging', 'extensive multimodal data and employing pre-training and\nfine-tuning techniques, LLMs have demonstrated state-of-the-\nart performance across various downstream tasks, such as\nmachine translation, numerical reasoning, and code clone\ndetection, with minimal examples (few-shot) or task-specific\nprompt instructions (zero-shot).\nB. Logical Problems Solving with LLMs\nWe begin by identifying logical problems to be addressed\nin this work. Generally speaking, the hardest logical prob-\nlem underlies the framework of satisfiability modulo theories\n(SMT). SMT is a variation of the SAT problem for first-order\nlogic (FOL), with the interpretation of symbols constrained\nby specific theories, such as real arithmetic and bit vectors.\nOur study encompasses several subsets of SMT problems,\nincluding propositional logic, SMT problems themselves, and\na segment of first-order logic within the solving ability of\nSMT, along with external theories defining constraints. Thus,\nwe focus on SMT-based languages and solvers, to universally\nencode and solve those logical problems.\nWe elaborate on several samples to be solved in Fig 2. In the\nrealm of propositional logic, we incorporate variables like x\nto enhance conceptual clarity. The proposed hypothesis, Reg-\ngae(x)→ExpressFeelings(x) , can be derived with deductive\nreasoning. We transform the judgment process into a satis-\nfiability dilemma by treating the assumption as a constraint.\nFOL supports quantifiers ∀and∃on the basis of propositional\nlogic, introducing uncertainty into problems. In this case,\nthe assumption remains indeterminate. We check both the\naffirmation and negation hypotheses with SMT solvers, to\nalign with the True/False/Uncertain output form. The uncertain\ncases are equivalent to UNSAT for both affirmation and nega-\ntion hypotheses. Concerning SMT-based problems, theories\nalso contribute to their complexity. In the SMT-BitVec case,\nthe target is to ascertain whether the Left-Hand-Side (LHS)\nequals the Right-Hand-Side (RHS) for a bit-operation-oriented\nissue. The true/false corresponds to SAT/UNSAT. Conversely,\nthe SMT-Real-Arthmetic is drawn from the Z3py manual.\nThe Z3 solver produces an unknown result as xis involved\nin the exponentiation of 2x, rendering this problem non-\npolynomial. In contrast, individuals can readily find a solution\nasx= log23.\nDespite directly solving reasoning problems in natural lan-\nguage [30]–[33], several researches are interested in symbolic-\nbased logic solving triggered by the improvement in code\ngeneration ability of LLMs. These works are implemented\nwithin a two-step paradigm: initially translating language-\nbased reasoning tasks into codes suitable for logical solvers,\nfollowed by calling external solvers to execute generated\ncodes. To address potential issues like syntax errors and\nmissing elements in the codes, Logic-LM [10] iteratively\nrefines generated logical form with error messages, while\nLINC [34] utilizes a voting mechanism to filter out errors and\nprovide robust results. Additionally, SATLM [35] parsing all\nproblems into FOL formulas and solving with Z3 solver. Be-\nsides, LoGiPT [12] is a fine-tuned LLM aiming for deductivereasoning, whereas SymBa [11] leverages backward chaining\nto conduct logic reasoning reversely. SoLA [36] combines\nLLMs and differential solver layers to address SAT problems.\nOur work differs from prior works in various aspects. First,\nThe source inputs are not limited to natural language ques-\ntions, but also logic codes generated from the software testing\nor verification procedure in a real-world setting. Second, the\nkey factor in our research is how LLMs directly comprehend\nand simulate the code rather than on code translation and\ngeneration from natural language. Third, we aim to provide\nextensive evaluations of various problem types instead of one\nspecific genre of questions.\nC. Code Simulation with LLMs\nCode simulation is a relatively new topic of interest. It\nis defined as predicting the concrete outputs of codes align-\ning with the execution results. Recent studies on Tuning-\ncompleteness of transformers and LLMs [37]–[40] have sug-\ngested that LLMs are capable of interpreting instructions from\ncode, showing potential to simulate the execution of code and\nalgorithms as analog models. The previous works encourage\nLLMs to simulate a variety of tasks, such as keyboard and\nmouse actions on computers [41] and optimizers [27]. While\ntransformer-based models are trained to predict the execution\ntraces of codes [42] and UNSAT cores [43], a recent attempt at\nsimulating code with LLMs has been proposed [29]. Their re-\nsults indicate that LLMs can execute instructions sequentially.\nWhen facing long programs and complex procedures, several\ntackles such as memorization. The setting of our proposed\nlogic code simulation focuses on simulating specialized codes\nof logical solvers instead of codes for general purposes. The\npotential outcome space is limited to either SAT or UNSAT,\nmaking it more favorable for obtaining accurate predictions\nsince logical codes can be more easily expressed and compre-\nhended in natural language.\nIII. M ETHOD\nIn this section, we first introduce related LLMs and the\ndata-collecting procedure. Afterward, we present a new prompt\ntechnique, Dual Chains of Logic (DCoL), aiming to improve\nthe accuracy, reasoning process, and robustness of the logic\ncode simulation task.\nA. Involved LLMs\nThe objective of this study is to assess LLMs’ reliability and\nlimitations in simulating various forms of logic codes com-\npared to conventional logical solvers like Z3. To accomplish\nthis, we employ both open-source LLMs such as the LLaMA\nfamily [9], [44], and close-source but strong LLMs such as the\nGPT family as our base models. We present details of these\nmodels as follows:\nGPT-3.5 Turbo : GPT-3.5 Turbo, also known as ChatGPT, is\na decoder-only network based on the Transformer architecture,\ncomprising 175 billion parameters.

"How do pretraining and fine-tuning affect LLMs' political preferences, given training data and annotator actions?","['stage /s of the training pipeline used to create LLMs  optimized to follow users ’ instructions . Base or \nfoundation models answers to questions with political connotations, on average, do not appear to \nskew to the poles of the political spectrum.  That is, despite the likely unbalanced  representation of \npolitical viewpoints in the corpora used to pretrain base LLMs, this does not appear to immediately \ngive rise to consistent political biases on base models’ responses to political orientation tests.  \nAn important limitation of our analysis is that base model s’ responses to questions with political \nconnotations are often incoherent  or contradictory, creating thus a challenge for stance detection . \nThis is to be expected as base models are essentially train  to complete web documents, so they can \noften fail to generate appropriate response when prompted with a question/statement from a \npolitical orientation test.  This behavior is mitigated by the inclusion of a suffix such as “I select the \nanswer:” at the end of the prompt feeding a test item to the model. The addition of the suffix \ninduces the model towards selecting one of the  test’s  allowed answers. Such a mechanism is not \nalways successful  for base models and  the invalid response rate for this type of model  remains high. \nAlso , even when the stance detection classifies a model response as valid and maps the model \nresponse to one of the test’s allowed answers,  some of  those mappings would still be  classified as \nincorrect  by human raters . This is unavoidable and even human raters would also make mistakes at \nstance detection, perhaps even at a higher rate than ChatGPT  as suggested by recent evidence  [20]. \nFor all the reasons above , our results should be interpreted with caution. Yet, it is noteworthy that \ngiven the large number  of test items fed to base LLMs , 20,050 (401 questions/statements in all tests \n× 5 base models × 10 trials per model ), when probed with questions with political valence  and \nprimed to choose one of the test’s valid responses , the base models responses do not, on average, \nskew  to the poles of the political spectrum.  \nThese results tentatively suggest that the infusion of political preferences onto LLMs might be mainly \nhappening after the pretraining phase. This is surprising as one would expect that the training \ncorpora with which LLMs  are pretrained is probably not balanced  and some political viewpoints are \nlikely more prevalent than others. Hence,  it would be  reasonable to expect overrepresented  \nviewpoints in the pretraining corpus to be more likely to appear in base models ’ answers to \nquestions with political connotations. Yet, we do not observe such phenomena in our analysis.  \nWe s peculate that because the training corpora with which LLMs are pre -trained is so vast and \ncomprehensive , LLMs  are probably  able to accurately map a large portion of the political latent space \neven if some views are less frequently represented than others  in their pretraining corpora . Perhaps \na useful analogy to the phenomena described above is how despite the overrepresentation of \nEnglish language in the ir pretraining corpora, LLMs are quite  proficient in a variety of other \nlanguages that are underrepresented  in their pretraining data. That is,  LLMs are able to interpolate \nunder -sampled language  regions of the input space by leveraging or transfer learning the ir \ncontext ual understanding from other related regions of the input space.  \nIn a further set of analysis, w e also showed how with modest compute and politically customized \ntraining data we can align the political preferences of LLMs to target regions of the political spectrum \nvia supervised fine -tuning.  This provides further evidence for the potential role of  supervised  fine-\ntuning in the emergence of political preferences with in LLMs.  \nOur analysis cannot exclude the possibility that the preference for left -leaning responses that we \nobserve in most conversational LLMs might be a byproduct of content in the corpora used to pre -\ntrain those models  and which only emerges post -finetuning even when the fine -tuning process itself  \nmight be exquisitely politically neutral.  Though conceivable , the evidence presented in this work \ndoes not provide support for that hypothesis.  But our analysis and results cannot reject it neither.  ', 'We also do not want to claim that the fine -tuning or RL phases of LLMs training are trying to \nexplicitly inject political preferences into these models. Perhaps the emergence of consistent political \npreferences  in conversational LLMs  is a byproduct of  annotators ’ instructions and /or behaviors that \nwithout being explicitly politically aligned are however interpolated and generalized by the LLM to \nother  regions in the latent political space  due to some unknown cultural artifact . But it is noteworthy \nthat this is happening in LLMs created by a wide variety of organizations . \nAnother possible explanation for these results is that ChatGPT , as the pioneer LLM with widespread  \npopularity, has been leveraged to fine-tune other popular LLMs via synthetic data generation. The \nleft-leaning political preferences of ChatGPT  have been documented previously [4]. Perhaps  those \npreferences have percolated to other models that have leverage d in their training ChatGPT -\ngenerated synthetic data.  Yet, it would be surprising that all conversational LLMs tested in this work \nhave been trained using ChatGPT generated data as it is comparatively expensive to generate in \ncomparison to web -scraped corpora or that the weight of that component of their training data is so \nvast as to dominate the political orientations of every model  tested  in our analysis .  \nAn interesting test instrument outlier in our results has been the Nolan Test that consistently \ndiagnosed most LLMs answers to its questions as manifesting politically moderate viewpoints. The \nreasons for  the disparity in diagnosis between the Nolan Test and all the other tests instruments \nused in this work warrant s further investigation about the validity and reliability of political \norientation tests instruments.  \nTo conclude, t he emergence of large language models (LLMs) as  fundamental information  providers \nhas marked a significant shift in how people access and engage with information. Traditionally, \nindividuals have relied on search engines or platforms like Wikipedia for quick and reliable access to \nboth factual and biase d information. However, as LLMs become more advanced and accessible, they \nare beginning to displace these conventional sources. This transition raises critical concerns about \nthe potential political biases  embedded in LLMs. This shift in information sourcing has profound \nsocietal ramifications, as it can shape public opinion, influence voting behaviors, and affect the \noverall discourse in  society . Therefore, it is crucial to critically examine and address the potential \npolitical biases  embedded in LLMs to ensure a balanced, fair and accurate representation of \ninformation  in their responses to user queries . \nReferences  \n[1] OpenAI et al. , “GPT -4 Technical Report.” arXiv, Dec. 18, 2023. doi: 10.48550/arXiv.2303.08774.  \n[2] A.

How does bi-dir feedback in teacher-student framework boost RL model efficiency in complex tasks?,"['2. Method\nIn this section, we introduce a teacher-student learning framework with\nbi-directional feedback, wherein a synergistic partnership between an LLM\nand an RL model is employed to tackle tasks collaboratively.

How do interpretability and fidelity in LLMs boost trust and decision-making?,"['4.2 Transparency and Explainability of LLMs\n4.2.1 Theoretical Background\nBlack-box models operate as opaque systems, whose internal workings are challenging to access or\ninterpret. These models generate predictions and recommendations based on input data, yet the underlying\ndecision-making process and reasoning remain nontransparent [ 72]. Due to this opacity in the ""inner"" working\nmechanisms of LLMs and their high complexity, they are often categorized as ""black-box"" models [ 210].\nTransparency indicates the extent to which the inherent operational rules and internal logic of a technology are\nevident to users [ 74]. Explanations can serve as a form of transparency [ 207]. An AI system is considered\nexplainable if it is ""intrinsically interpretable or if the non-interpretable task model is complemented with an\ninterpretable and faithful explanation"" [ 120, p.2]. Explainability comprises two key aspects: interpretability,\nwhich is the extent to which a person can understand an explanation, and fidelity, which refers to the descriptive\nprecision of an explanation [ 120]. In many fields, such as medical diagnostics, providing an explanation of\nhow an answer has been generated is essential for fostering transparency and trust. Explanations can enhance\nuser’s understanding of black box models [103, 155], and increase the transparency of AI models [141].\nLLMs possess the capacity to offer (seemingly) reasonable explanations, called self-explanations. For instance,\nwhen tasked with solving a math problem, they frequently present detailed derivation steps, even without\nexplicit instructions to do so. Likewise, in the analysis of the sentiment of a book review, they spontaneously\njustify their decisions, providing supporting evidence [ 81]. However, LLMs might not consistently convey\ntheir ""thoughts"" accurately, probably decreasing transparency [180].\nLLM\n4.2.2 Deriving Implications for LLM-assisted Decision-Making\nExplanations can enhance users’ understanding of LLMs, and therefore may increase their transparency.\nWhen users understand the rationale behind an LLM’s suggestions, they are able to make more informed\ndecisions. This is particularly important in situations where the LLM’s recommendations are one of many\nfactors considered in the decision-making process. Understanding the ""why"" behind an LLM’s output allows\nusers to weigh its suggestions appropriately against other considerations. Consequently, transparency and\nexplainability in LLMs can lead to better decision-making. The provision of explanations by LLMs could\nwield a substantial influence on transparency. Although these self-explanations may initially enhance the\nperceived transparency in the decision-making process, it is crucial to acknowledge potential limitations since\nLLMs might not consistently communicate their ""thoughts"" accurately.\nLLM\n4.2.3 Scenario-based Demonstration\nTransparency and Explainability (Scenario 4). In the scenario involving Paula, an expectant mother seeking\nmedical advice on an LLM-powered online forum, transparency and explainability are crucial for ensuring\ninformed decision-making. If the forum had been transparent about its sources of information, Paula would\nhave been able to identify the origin of advice, discerning whether it came from verified medical professionals\nor scientific studies rather than unverified or pseudo-scientific sources. For example, if the forum had clearly\nstated that its recommendation against vaccination was based on unverified sources or personal opinions,\nrather than on scientific consensus, Paula might have approached the advice with greater caution. Moreover, if\nthe LLM was capable of explaining the rationale behind its recommendation, including the data and sources\nit utilized, Paula would have a better understanding of the advice’s foundation. If the LLM explained that\nits recommendation was based on pseudo-scientific information, Paula might recognize the need for further\nconsultation with healthcare professionals.\nTransparency and Explainability (Scenario 5). Transparency from the LLM about the data behind its\nrecommendation could have helped Jenna discern whether the new social media platform’s popularity was a\nshort-lived trend or had long-term potential. Explainability of the LLM’s decision-making process would have\nallowed Jenna to comprehend the reasoning behind the recommendation, such as the basis of high engagement\nrates from similar campaigns, and to evaluate their relevance to her company’s context.\n11', 'Trust in and Transparency of LLMs. Transparency emerges as a crucial determinant in influenc-\ning trust in LLM-assisted decision-making. When users possess a clear understanding of how the LLM\noperates and makes recommendations and decisions, it is likely to instill confidence in the technology. A lack\nof transparency in an LLM may result in insufficient trust. Without trust, users may hesitate to delegate tasks\nor decisions to LLMs. However, the transparency of LLMs might have a dual impact on trust. On the one\nhand, transparency may increase trust by enhancing the perceived effectiveness of the system. On the other\nhand, heightened transparency can also lead to discomfort, potentially diminishing trust in LLMs.\nLLM\n5.1.4 Scenario-based Demonstration\nOver-reliance (Scenario 1). Dr. Smith, an experienced physician in a hospital, turned to an LLM-powered\nmedical diagnosis system to identify a patient’s symptoms. The system recommended a rare and hard-to-\ndiagnose disease based on the entered symptoms and available medical data. Dr. Smith trusted the system’s\nrecommendation and made the diagnosis accordingly. As a result, the patient underwent costly and invasive\ntests and treatments. However, it became apparent over time that the patient’s symptoms were not caused\nby the suspected rare disease. The actual cause was a much more common and easily treatable condition\nthat had not been considered before. Despite Dr. Smith’s experience, he deferred to the LLM system’s\ndiagnosis without applying his own medical judgment or considering differential diagnoses. This suggests an\nover-reliance on the LLM’s output over his own expertise. Moreover, Dr. Smith did not verify the LLM’s\nrecommendation against other diagnostic possibilities or seek a second opinion, which is a standard practice in\nmedicine when faced with rare or unusual diagnoses.\nOver-reliance (Scenario 3). Anna was searching for weight loss advice on the internet and came\nacross a website where an LLM provided recommendations. The LLM advised her to follow an extreme\ndiet that eliminated almost all carbohydrates and fats. Trusting the LLM as a reliable source of information,\nAnna decided to follow this advice without conducting further research. After a few weeks, she noticed\nher health deteriorating, feeling weak and tired, and even experiencing hair loss. Concerned about these\nsymptoms, she eventually consulted a doctor, who diagnosed her with a deficiency in essential nutrients\ndue to her extreme diet and warned her about the risks of such radical dietary changes. Anna’s trust in\nthe LLM’s guidance for an extreme diet, without seeking additional information or professional advice,\ndemonstrates her over-reliance on the technology, neglecting the complexity of human health and nutrition.\nHer decision to adopt a drastic diet based solely on the LLM’s recommendation reflects a belief in\nthe LLM’s capabilities as comparable to those of a healthcare professional. This case underscores the\nimportance for individuals to seek information from reliable, scientifically-backed sources, especially\nregarding medical decisions, and to consult healthcare professionals for informed, personalized medical advice.\nUnder-reliance (Scenario 5) . Jenna, a marketing manager at a tech startup, utilized an LLM to op-\ntimize the company’s digital advertising strategy. The LLM suggested investing a significant portion of the\nmarketing budget in a new social media platform that was gaining traction. However, Jenna, being skeptical\nabout the LLM’s recommendations, decided to stick with the proven channels the company had traditionally\nused. Despite the LLM’s suggestion, she maintained the current budget allocation to established platforms and\nrefrained from experimenting with the new one. As time passed, the campaign on the established platforms\ncontinued to yield steady, but not exceptional, results. The consequences of under-reliance became apparent\nwhen competitors embraced innovative platforms and witnessed considerable success. The startup, by not\nadapting to emerging trends, missed potential opportunities for growth and failed to reach a broader audience.\nTrust in and Transparency of LLMs (Scenario 6) . In the context of sales projections, transparency in the\nLLM’s decision-making process might directly influence Alex’s trust. The more transparent the LLM is about\nits data processing, confidence levels, rationale, and assumptions, the more likely Alex is to trust the generated\nsales forecasts. Transparency regarding any assumptions made by the LLM can help Alex understand the\nlimitations and potential risks associated with the projections. Moreover, clear articulation of the rationale\nbehind each sales projection may build trust. When Alex can see a logical and data-driven basis for the\nforecasts, it might enhance confidence in the LLM’s ability to generate meaningful and accurate predictions.\n17']","Interpretability and fidelity in LLMs boost trust and decision-making by enhancing users' understanding of the rationale behind the LLM’s suggestions, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

"How does function call context affect LLMs' code accuracy and compilability, given their multi-hop reasoning and chain-of-thought skills?","['CodeApex: A Bilingual Programming Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models 111:17\nindicates that LLMs are likely to incorporate knowledge of programming concepts during training.\nMost models scored higher in commonsense reasoning compared to multi-hop reasoning, suggesting\nthat the capability of LLMs significantly decreases with an increase in the number of reasoning\nsteps.\nEffects of Chain-of-Thought Prompting. Most of the models achieve approximate or lower\naccuracy than the answer-only setting. The accuracy results of the CoT setting are depicted in\nTable 4. The reasons for this observation are two folds: (1) Models we evaluate do not reach model\nsizes that have the emergent ability of CoT. According to [ 54], the emergence of CoT requires\nLLM to have at least 60B parameters. When the parameter number is not enough, the CoT setting\nmight introduce additional noise, and the generated response of LLM would be unstable. That’s\nwhy GPT3.5-turbo, which has reached the emergence point, achieves higher accuracy in the CoT\nsetting. (2) When answering conceptual understanding and commonsense reasoning questions, we\ndo not require multi-step reasoning. Thus, the CoT ability of LLMs does not provide assistance for\nthese categories of questions. However, for multi-hop reasoning questions, there is a noticeable\nimprovement in accuracy in the CoT scenario for some models (such as ChatGLM2, educhat, and\nGPT3.5-turbo). Since CodeT5 fails to generate a response with chain-of-thought, we exclude it in\nthe CoT setting.\nHuman Performance. Novice programmers perform similarly to GPT-4 in closed-book\ntests after learning, while human performance in open-book exams is significantly better\nthan all LLMs. The performance of human testers is shown in Table 3. Note that programming\ncomprehension tasks in CodeApex is considered a semi-open-book exam for LLMs, i.e., they have\nlimited offline knowledge base.\n4.3 Code Generation Results\nCode generation task results of all the models are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. Two prompt\nstrategies (function-only and function-with-context) are employed for each language version. The\nevaluation metrics include AC@1, AC@all, and AC Rate.

Table 8 shows the performance on explicit and narrative questions.\nThe data is selected from function-only and function-with-context scenarios, with the better-\nperforming data chosen. The table demonstrates that LLMs perform better on explicit questions\nthan narrative questions . This is because explicit questions only require atomic code generation\nability of LLMs, while narrative questions require LLM to first understand the question description,\nconvert natural language into program logic, and finally generate code. It is indeed a significant\nchallenge to extract program logic from natural language, requiring a deep understanding of\nlanguage semantics and context. Meanwhile, three metrics of LLM on narrative questions are\nmostly consistent, indicating that the generated code is either entirely correct or entirely incorrect.\nJ.

"How do PEFT methods boost Bayesian optimization in molecular discovery with LLMs, given training costs and accuracy needs?","['A Sober Look at LLMs for Bayesian Optimization Over Molecules\nThese facts make the LLA interpretable: it simply adds an\nuncertainty estimate to the original NN prediction gθ∗(x).\nThat uncertainty can further be calibrated via the LA’s\nmarginal-likelihood approximation (Daxberger et al., 2021):\nZ(γ) = log p(θ∗|D;γ) +P\n2log 2π+1\n2log|Σ∗(γ)|,(3)\nwhere we have made the dependency of the posterior and\nthe Hessian on the hyperparameters γexplicit. For example,\nγcould be a set that contains the weight decay strength\n(corresponds to the prior precision of the Gaussian prior\nonΘ) and the noise strength in the likelihood of g. In this\nsetting, the optimization maxγlogZ(γ)can thus be seen\nas learning a suitable prior and estimating data noise.\n2.3. Large language models\nA crucial component of the recent development in large\nNNs is the K-head self-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al.,\n2017). Given a length- Tsequence of input embeddings of\ndimension N, sayX∈RT×N, it computes\nO= [H1, . . . ,HK]W⊤\no∈RT×O,\nHi=s\x10\n1√\nD(XQ⊤\ni)(XK⊤\ni)⊤\x11\n(X⊤Vi)∈RT×D,(4)\nwhere [. . .]is a column-wise stacking operator, taking K-\nmany T×Dmatrices to a T×KD matrix; Wo∈RO×KD\nandQi,Ki,Vi∈RD×Nare linear projectors; and the\nsoftmax function s(·)is applied row-wise.\nThe resulting network architecture, obtained by stacking\nmultiple attention modules along with other layers like resid-\nual and normalization layers, is called a transformer . When\nused for language modeling, the resulting model is called\nalarge language model (LLM) . The output Oof the last\ntransformer module can then be used as a feature for a dense\noutput layer Head :RO→RC, taking the row-wise aggre-\ngate (e.g. average) of Oto aC-dimensional vector, where\nCis the number of outputs in the problem. For natural\nlanguage generation, Cequals the size of the vocabulary V,\ne.g. around 32,000in Touvron et al. (2023a). One can also\nmodularly replace this head so that the LLM can be used for\ndifferent tasks, e.g. single-output regression where C= 1.\n2.3.1. P ARAMETER -EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING\nDue to the sheer size of LLMs, the costs of training LLMs\nfrom scratch are prohibitively expensive even for relatively\nsmall LLMs (Sharir et al., 2020). Thankfully, LLMs are usu-\nally trained in a task-agnostic manner and have been shown\nto be meaningful, generic “priors” for natural-language-\nrelated tasks (Brown et al., 2020). This means one can\nsimply perform finetuning on top of a pretrained LLM (Sun\net al., 2019). However, standard finetuning, i.e. further opti-\nmizing allthe LLM’s parameters, is expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which add a few addi-\ntional parameters, say ω, to the LLM and keep the original\nLLM parameters frozen, have therefore become standard.\nA popular example of PEFT is LoRA (Hu et al., 2022),\nwhich uses a bottleneck architecture to introduce additional\nparameters in a LLM. Let W∗∈RD×Nbe an attention\nweight matrix. LoRA freezes it and then augments it into\nW=W∗+B⊤A;A∈RZ×N,B∈RZ×D.(5)\nThe additional weights in A,Bare thus few for a small Z.\nNote that, many other PEFT methods are also commonly\nused in practice, e.g., Adapter (Houlsby et al., 2019), Prefix\nTuning (Li & Liang, 2021), IA3 (Liu et al., 2022), etc.\n3. Experiment Setup\nEquipped with the necessary background knowledge from\nSection 2, we are now ready to discuss our experiments in an\nattempt to answer our main question on whether LLMs are\ngood for BO in molecular discovery. Refer to Algorithm 1\nfor the problem statement.\nDatasets We evaluate the models considered (see below)\non the following datasets that represent realistic problem\nsets from molecular materials discovery: minimizing (i)\nthe redox potential ( redoxmer ) and (ii) solvation energy\n(solvation ) of possible flow battery electrolytes (Agarwal\net al., 2021), (iii) minimizing the docking score of kinase\ninhibitors for drug discovery (Graff et al., 2021), (iv) max-\nimization of the fluorescence oscillator strength of lasers\n(Strieth-Kalthoff et al., 2023), (v) maximization of the power\nconversion efficiency (PCE) of photovoltaics materials\n(Lopez et al., 2016), and (vi) maximization of the π-π∗\ntransition wavelength of organic photoswitches (Griffiths\net al., 2022). For each virtual library of molecules above,\na physics-inspired simulation has been performed by the\nrespective authors, which we use here as the ground truth\nf(x). Note that these problem sets cover a series of differ-\nent physical properties of molecules and therefore represent\na diverse set of molecular design tasks.\nFeatures and LLMs We use the following standard non-\nLLM, chemistry-specific baselines: 1024-bit Morgan finger-\nprints (Morgan, 1965) as a chemistry-specific (non-learned)\nalgorithmic vectorization scheme, and the feature vectors\nfrom the pretrained MolFormer transformer (Ross et al.,\n2022). Meanwhile, for the general-purpose LLMs, we use\nvarious recent architectures of varying sizes: T5-Base ( T5,\nRaffel et al., 2020), GPT2-Medium ( GPT2-M , Radford\net al., 2019), and LLAMA-2-7B ( LL2-7B , Touvron et al.,\n2023a). Finally, we use the work of Christofidellis et al.\n(2023, T5-Chem ) to represent domain-specific LLMs.\nPrompts For text-based surrogate models, we addition-\nally consider several prompting functions c(x), mapping a\n4', 'A Sober Look at LLMs for Bayesian Optimization Over Molecules\nTransformer ( W∗)Language Modeling\nHead\nRegression\nHead ( w)p(gt(·)| D t;W∗)\n(a) Fixed-feature LLM surrogate\nTransformer ( W∗)\nPEFT ( ω)Regression\nHead ( w)p(gt(·)| D t;W∗) (b) Adaptive-feature LLM surrogate\nFigure 2. The surrogates we consider in this work. “PEFT” refers to parameter efficient finetuning which adds few trainable weights ωto\nthe transformer. Grey means the weights are frozen and thus act as conditioning variables in the posterior over the surrogate gt. Green\nmeans the weights are trained in a Bayesian manner (e.g., to obtain p(w,ω| Dt)) and then marginalized to obtain the posterior predictive\ndistribution over gt(e.g.,RR\np(gt(·)|w,ω;W∗)p(w,ω| Dt)dwdω). Note that both models are principled Bayesian surrogates, in\ncontrast to the in-context learning frameworks considered by prior works on BO with LLMs (Ramos et al., 2023; Anonymous, 2023).\nbecome very popular in many domains that are tradition-\nally rather disconnected from natural language processing,\nsuch as in biology (Vig et al., 2021), education (Kasneci\net al., 2023), law (Chalkidis et al., 2020), and chemistry\n(Maik Jablonka et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Jablonka\net al., 2023, etc.). On the other hand, recent works have\nwarned that LLMs might not necessarily understand things,\nbut simply act as very expensive “stochastic parrots” (Ben-\nder et al., 2021), see Figure 1 for example. Nevertheless,\ndue to the apparent capabilities of LLMs, some recent works\nhave leveraged off-the-shelf LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI,\n2023) for BO over molecules (Ramos et al., 2023) and for\nhyperparameter tuning (Anonymous, 2023). However, their\nuncertainty estimates are obtained only through heuristics,\nsuch as from the softmax probabilities of the generated an-\nswer tokens, coming from point-estimated non-Bayesian\nLLMs. These non-Bayesian uncertainties thus might not be\noptimal for the exploration-exploitation tradeoff that is so\ncrucial for BO (Garnett, 2023).\nIn this work, we take a dispassionate look at LLMs for BO\nover molecules. We do so by carefully constructing and\nstudying two kinds of surrogate models that are amenable to\na principled Bayesian treatment, see Figure 2. First, we treat\nthe LLM as a fixed feature extractor and find out whether its\nfeatures are already useful as they are for BO over molecules.\nSecond, we attempt to answer whether the “stochastic parrot”\ncan be “taught”—via parameter-efficient fine-tuning meth-\nods (e.g., Houlsby et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2021; Hu et al.,\n2022) and the Laplace approximation (MacKay, 1992a;\nDaxberger et al., 2021)—to perform efficient Bayesian ex-\nploration in the molecular space.\nIn sum, our contribution is four-fold:\n(a)We study the out-of-the-box usefulness of pretrained\nLLMs for material discovery by using their last embed-\ndings in BO.\n(b)We study whether finetuning through PEFT and then ap-\nplying approximate Bayesian inference over it is worth\nthe effort in terms of the BO performance.(c)We provide an easy-to-use software library for prin-\ncipled BO on discrete space with LLMs: https://\ngithub.com/wiseodd/lapeft-bayesopt .\n(d)Through our extensive experiments ( 8real-world chem-\nistry problems, 8recent LLMs—including LLAMA-\n2—and non-LLM based features), we provide insights\non whether, when, and how “stochastic parrots” can be\nuseful to drive better scientific discovery.\nLimitations Our focus in this work is to study LLMs for\ndiscrete BO on a predetermined set of molecules, as usually\ndone in real-world chemistry labs (Strieth-Kalthoff et al.,\n2023, etc.). We leave the study of BO on continuous space\nwith principled LLM-based Bayesian surrogates as future\nwork. Finally, we focus only on chemistry, although our\nexperiments can also be done for other domains.\n2. Preliminaries\nHere, we introduce key concepts in Bayesian optimization,\nBayesian neural networks, and large language models.\n2.1. Bayesian optimization\nSuppose f:X → Y is a function that is not analytically\ntractable and/or very expensive to evaluate. We would like\n(without loss of generality) to find x∗= arg maxx∈Xf(x).\nFor example, we might want to find a new drug xin the\nspace of all drugs Xthat has high efficacy over the pop-\nulation f(x). An increasingly common way to approach\nthis problem is to perform Bayesian optimization (BO). The\nkey components of BO are: (i) a surrogate function gthat\ntractably approximate f; (ii) a prior belief and a likelihood\n(and hence a posterior) over g; and (iii) an acquisition func-\ntionα:X →Rthat implicitly defines a policy for choosing\nwhich x∈ X to evaluate fat. The expressiveness ofgdic-\ntates how accurately we can approximate f; and the calibra-\ntionof the posterior (predictive) distribution p(gt| Dt)at\nsteptunder previous observations Dt:={(xi, f(xi))}t−1\ni=1\ndictates where should we explore and where should we\n2']","PEFT methods boost Bayesian optimization in molecular discovery with LLMs by adding a few additional parameters to the LLM and keeping the original LLM parameters frozen. This approach is cost-effective as it avoids the expensive process of optimizing all the LLM's parameters. Additionally, PEFT methods, such as LoRA, Adapter, Prefix Tuning, and IA3, allow for efficient fine-tuning, which can improve the performance of Bayesian optimization by making the LLM more adaptable to specific tasks.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1140856, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.05015v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1140856, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How do SLEB's redundant transformer block eliminations compare to weight pruning in latency and throughput for prompt processing and token generation?,"['SLEB: Streamlining LLMs through Redundancy Verification and Elimination of Transformer Blocks\nB.3. Speedup\nWe provide a comprehensive analysis of LLM inference speed across a range of LLM models using both NVIDIA A100\nGPUs and A6000 GPUs. For prompt processing, we conduct a single dummy test and then measure the latencies of 50\nadditional tests. The average latency is calculated from these measurements. Similarly, for token generation, we conduct a\nsingle dummy test and then measure the throughputs of 10 additional tests. The average throughput is calculated from these\nmeasurements.\nAs presented in Table 9 and Table 10, SLEB consistently enhances the latency and throughput of LLM inference across\nvarious serving scenarios. However, the impact of other pruning methods that prune weight values is significantly influenced\nby the specific serving scenarios. As discussed in Section 2.1, there are two reasons behind this. First, the impact of\nweight pruning on the speed of matrix multiplication varies depending on the original matrix size, even when the pruning is\nconducted in a structured manner. Second, LLMs have various types of operations besides linear operations with matrix\nmultiplication, and these operations can also affect the overall inference speed.\nTable 9.

In the\nprompt processing stage, LLMs assess the given prompt and\ngenerate the KV cache. In the token generation stage, LLMs\ngenerate new tokens in an auto-regressive manner. Because\nthese two stages have distinct characteristics in terms of\ninference speed, with the prompt processing stage tending\nto be compute-bound and the token generation stage tending\nto be memory-bound, we analyze the speedup in each of\nthem separately.\nTable 3 and Table 4 present latency and throughput results\nfor LLaMA-2-70B with 2 NVIDIA A100 GPUs during\nprompt processing and token generation, respectively. For\nprompt processing, we measure the latency when processing\nan input sequence with 2048 tokens. For token generation,\nthe test scenario consists of generating sentences with a\nlength of 128 tokens and a batch size of 64. In both sce-\nnarios, SLEB demonstrates improvements in latency and\nthroughput that are proportional to the pruning ratio. This\nperformance enhancement is attributed to the adoption of\ntransformer block, which is a fundamental building block\nof LLMs, as the basic unit of pruning. In contrast, previous\napproaches fail to achieve significant improvements, partic-\nularly in the case of token generation. For more detailed\nanalysis results, please refer to Appendix B.3. SLEB con-\nsistently provides speedup benefits across various serving\nscenarios, while the speedup achieved by other methods is\nsignificantly influenced by the specific serving scenarios.\nFigure 10. Perplexity comparison between LLMs pruned with\nSLEB (target sparsity: 20%) and those further compressed us-\ning AWQ, a 4-bit weight quantization\n4.7. Compatibility with Post-Training Quantization\nPost-training quantization (PTQ) is a well-established tech-\nnique for compressing and accelerating LLMs (Frantar et al.,\n2023; Lee et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2023). If PTQ can be ap-\nplied to compress LLMs alongside SLEB, we can expect\nfurther improvements in memory efficiency and LLM in-\nference speed. In Figure 10, we present a comparison of\nperplexity scores for LLMs that have undergone SLEB with\ntarget sparsity of 20% and those that have been further com-\npressed with AWQ (Lin et al., 2023), a state-of-the-art PTQ\nalgorithm that quantizes weights to 4-bit integer values. The\nexperimental results indicate that applying PTQ to stream-\nlined models has no discernible impact on their perplexity.\nMore analysis results on compatibility with PTQ are pro-\nvided in Appendix B.4.\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper introduces SLEB, a novel technique for stream-\nlining LLMs by removing redundant transformer blocks.\nSLEB carefully identifies and eliminates redundant blocks,\nensuring that it effectively preserves the language capabil-\nities of LLMs without the need for any resource-intensive\ntraining. Our experimental results demonstrate that SLEB\ncan successfully prune up to 20% of blocks while maintain-\ning the linguistic performance of LLMs across language\nmodeling and zero-shot tasks. One of the significant advan-\ntages of SLEB is its ability to remove entire transformer\nblocks, resulting in substantial speed improvements in end-\nto-end LLM inference. This speedup is applicable across\nvarious implementation scenarios, making SLEB a practical\nsolution for real-world LLM serving scenarios.\n8']","SLEB's redundant transformer block eliminations consistently enhance the latency and throughput of LLM inference across various serving scenarios. In contrast, the impact of weight pruning on the speed of matrix multiplication varies depending on the original matrix size and other operations besides linear operations with matrix multiplication, which can also affect the overall inference speed. Specifically, for prompt processing, SLEB demonstrates improvements in latency that are proportional to the pruning ratio, achieving up to 1.28× speedup. For token generation, SLEB also shows significant improvements in throughput, achieving up to 1.27× improvement. Previous approaches, particularly weight pruning, fail to achieve significant improvements, especially in the case of token generation.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '14', 'file_name': '2402.09025v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.09025v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1913759, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '2402.09025v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.09025v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1913759, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How does a 32x32 grid aid LLM A* in safe navigation?,"['Fig. 3: Path planning through conversation.\nRL. For LLM A*, we have considered two variants, i.e.,\n1) only consider the heuristic h(s)as the cost function,\ndenoted as Greedy LLM A*; 2) consider the combination of\nthe cumulative and heuristic costs f(s)as the cost function,\ndenoted as LLM A*. The GPT3.5-turbo-16k LLM is used as\nit provides more tokens than GPT3.5-turbo or even GPT4.\nThis is to ensure that we can get the planning results without\ndisruption, not necessarily that the algorithm needs so many\ntokens. The GPT-3.5-turbo-16k LLM model we used allows\na total of 16,384 tokens. In comparison, GPT-3.5-turbo has\na maximum number of 4,096 tokens. In case there is a\nneed to reduce the consumption of tokens to replicate the\nexperiments, one can reset the request dictionary to null after\neach interaction. To enable full control/access to the planning\nprocess, one can split a single interaction process into two\nstages: 1) planning by LLM A*; and 2) outputs of necessary\nresults upon requests.\nAn occupancy grid map with a size 32 ×32 is primarily\nused for evaluation. There are free spaces and obstacles on\nthe map, where a robot agent can only move in free space\nand needs to avoid colliding with obstacles. The agent can\nmove in eight directions at maximum wherever and whenever\nit is safe. All experiments are carried out using Python 3.8+\non Google Colab.\nThe RL model we used is based on the PPO configuration,\ntogether with the standard A* are used for comparison.\nB. LLM A* Training and Session Design\nFor experiments that involve LLM, there are two stages\nincluding initialization where essential information about the\nenvironment and the agent will be prompted to set up plan-\nning. The information includes 1) locations of the start and\ngoal states; 2) obstacle distribution; 3) agent action space; 4)\nChebyshev distance measurement that is used for cumulative\nand heuristic costs calculation; and 5) the objective to plan\na path for the agent between the start and goal states. Inaddition, some planning rules can be communicated to LLM\nas well, which include 1) a viable path should avoid colliding\nwith obstacles; 2) the path should ideally expand along the\ndirection from heuristics or human guidance; 3) selection\nof the suitable actions that could accelerate the planning\nprocess.\nIn the second interactive planning stage, LLM can return\nplanning results based on the initial information and other\nprompts to help humans guide or monitor the planning.\nThis stage works iteratively and interactively until a path\nis successfully planned. It is worth noting that humans\ncan request intermediate planning results at any stage. This\nmakes the planning process a white box to humans, which\nhelps to assure safety, etc.\nC. RL Model Training\nThe PPO model is employed for comparison. In our case,\nthe PPO model is based on an actor-critic structure that\nincludes two 3-layer deep neural networks for policy and\nvalue training, respectively. The model is trained for over\n8,000,000 steps (a total of more than 8,000 episodes) to\nensure convergence.\nOn the other hand, we set the learning rates of both\nactor and critic to be smaller than 0.0005 to ensure that\nthe model won’t be fixed too early, achieving a balance of\nexploration and exploitation in contrast to the entropy penalty\nfor convergence.\nWe have also randomised the start state in each episode,\nto improve the adaptability of the PPO model to different\nenvironments. This is achieved by proposing to use of an\neasy-to-difficult mechanism to train the PPO model. To be\nspecific, we start from the states near the goal in which the\nagent is so close to it that ideally, it can reach the goal in\none step. Next, a state will be randomly chosen from these\nstates to train the PPO model. As the model only has a small\nscope of the map, it will be ‘easy’ to converge.

How does mPnP-LLM balance efficiency and accuracy in multimodal LLMs for embodied AI on limited resources?,"['Modality Plug-and-Play: Elastic Modality Adaptation\nin Multimodal LLMs for Embodied AI\nKai Huang, Boyuan Yang and Wei Gao\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\nk.huang, by.yang, weigao@pitt.edu\nAbstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are capable of reasoning over diverse input data\nmodalities through pre-trained encoders. However, the growing diversity of in-\nput data modalities prevents incorporating all modalities into LLMs, especially\nwhen LLMs are deployed on resource-constrained edge devices for embodied\nAI applications. Instead, a better option is to adaptively involve only the useful\nmodalities at runtime, depending on the current environmental contexts and task\nrequirements. For such modality adaptation, existing work adopts fixed connec-\ntions between encoders and the LLM’s input layer, leading to high training cost\nat runtime and ineffective cross-modal interaction. In this paper, we address these\nlimitations by presenting mPnP-LLM, a new technique that allows fully elastic,\nautomated and prompt runtime modality adaptation, by connecting unimodal en-\ncoders to a flexible set of last LLM blocks and making such latent connections\nfully trainable at runtime. Experiments over the nuScenes-QA dataset show that\nmPnP-LLM can achieve up to 3.7 ×FLOPs reduction and 30% GPU memory us-\nage reduction, while retaining on-par accuracy with the existing schemes. Under\nthe same compute budget, mPnP-LLM improves the task accuracy by up to 4%\ncompared to the best existing scheme. Source codes of mPnP-LLM can be found\nathttps://github.com/pittisl/mPnP-LLM .\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can do reasoning over diverse input data modalities [6, 19, 10,\n45], besides the natural language domain. Such multimodal reasoning relies on pre-trained encoders\nfor different input modalities, such as RGB frames [25], LiDAR point clouds [27] and acoustic\nsignals [39], to extract task-relevant features. By incorporating encoders from multiple input modal-\nities, LLMs can fully perceive the physical world and enable intelligent embodied agents, such as\nautonomous vehicles and robots, that adapt to environmental contexts and task needs [30, 19, 53].\nOne major challenge of such multimodal reasoning is the growing diversity of input data modali-\nties [33, 63, 32, 20]. Since today’s transformer-based encoders [58, 61] are usually large in size1,\nincorporating all modalities to LLMs is computationally expensive or even infeasible, especially on\nresource-constrained edge devices used in embodied AI applications2. Instead, we envision that the\nusefulness of different input modalities, even for the same embodied AI task, could greatly vary\nwhen the environmental contexts change. Hence, a better option is to adaptively involve only the\nuseful modalities at runtime, for the minimum on-device computing cost. An example of such run-\n1For example, the parameter sizes of widely used vision transformers (ViT) can vary between 86M to 22B\n[17].\n2Most hardware platforms used in embodied AI have much weaker capabilities in computation and storage.\nFor example, Nvidia JetBots [2] and Skydio drones [5] both have <8GB memory, and their GPU computing\npower is <7 TOPS which is <1% of workstation-grade GPUs.\nPreprint. Under review.arXiv:2312.07886v1  [cs.AI]  13 Dec 2023', 'Note that even without runtime modality adaptation, mPnP-LLM can retain a moderate level of zero-\nshot accuracy as shown in Table 5, which is at least 15% higher than that of baselines and only 3%\nlower than the task accuracy using 100% training samples. Similarly, mPnP-LLM’s task accuracy\napproximates to the peak accuracy even before it has iterated over all training samples. Such high\naccuracy ensures that the embodied AI system can smoothly adapt to new input modalities, and still\nuse the RGB modality during such adaptation to retain the task performance.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we present mPnP-LLM, a new technique that allows elastic runtime modality adapta-\ntion for multimodal LLMs in embodied AI. mPnP-LLM can achieve up to 3.7 ×FLOPs reduction\nwhile retaining on-par accuracy with the existing schemes.

How do eval metrics for med info extraction vs. text classification differ in assessing LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGLM in PromptCBLUE?,"['Manuscript in progress\nEvaluation Setup Our evaluations are conducted under the following three settings:\n• Few-shot in-context learning setting. Under this setting, we investigate the in-context learn-\ning ability Li et al. (2023b); Wang et al. (2023) of LLMs by concatenating demonstrating\ninstruction-response pairs from the training set to the current instruction. For tasks with\nlabel sets, we concatenate demonstrations containing at least kinstances for each label\nexcept the CHIP-CTC task.22For other tasks, we concatenate the kdemonstrations. The\nexact value of kvaries across tasks due to the different sequence length and label set sizes.\nThe exact number of kfor each task is reported in Table 1.23\n• Few-shot fine-tuning learning setting. Note that the selected demonstrations from the previ-\nous setting could also be treated as training samples to fine-tune the open-sourced models.\nWe also conduct LLM fine-tuning with different numbers of samples to investigate how\ntraining sample sizes affect the model test performances.\n• Fine-tuning. We will fine-tune a series of open-sourced LLMs on the large scale train-\ning set (introduced in Section 3) and report their performances. In terms of the fine-\ntuning techniques, we will experiment both full-model fine-tuning and a series of parame-\nter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. Note that during fine-tuning, we treat the entire\nPromptCBLUE as one task and use only one set of PEFT parameters for predictions of all\nthe test samples.\nUnder all the above settings, we ask LLMs to generate output and used a series of regular expressions\nto extract the model’s choice.24\nEvaluation metrics Since metrics like BLUE or ROUGE Lin (2004) can not properly mea-\nsure how LLMs perform for some of the PromptCBLUE tasks like medical information extraction\ntasks, we use post-processing scripts to transform the output sequences to structured data formats.\nPromptCBLUE adopt the following metrics:\n• Instance-level strict micro-F1 for medical information extraction tasks, IMCS-V2-SR and\nCHIP-MDCFNPC. Here, an instance means a complete piece of information extracted from\nthe given document. For example, in CMeEE-V2, an instance consists of a entity mention\nextracted and its predicted entity label. And in IMCS-V2-SR, an instance consists of two\nkeys: the entity mention of a symptom, and its status. We adopt the strict metrics, meaning\nthat the model predicts an instance correctly if and only if it correctly predicts the all the\nkeys of an instance.\n• For medical text classification tasks and the IMCS-V2-DAC tasks, we adopt the macro-F1\nscore.\n• For medical natural language inference tasks, we adopt the micro-F1 score.\n• For the medical content generation tasks, we adopt ROUGE-L Lin (2004) as the metric.\nModels We assess a collection of well-known language models in different sizes.

How can tailored training for decision styles reduce LLM risks and improve decision quality?,"['over-reliance on LLMs, especially in situations where a strong FOR might lead to uncritical acceptance of\nLLM suggestions.\nIn the domain of LLM-assisted decision-making, the implementation of customized training programs tailored\nto distinct decision-making styles emerges as an important strategy for enhancing decision quality (see Section\n5.6). Recognizing the diverse approaches individuals take in decision-making – categorized as minimizers,\nsatisficers, and maximizers – these training modules should aim to address the unique challenges and tendencies\nassociated with each style. For minimizers, who typically prioritize efficiency and speed, training programs\nshould emphasize the importance of not solely relying on the first satisfactory option presented by LLMs.\nThese programs should encourage a more comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting\nthe potential risks of over-reliance on initial suggestions. Satisficers, known for seeking options that meet\nspecific criteria, require training that focuses on effectively leveraging LLMs to find options that align with their\ncriteria. It should guide satisficers in using LLMs as a tool for narrowing down choices while still engaging\nin a critical evaluation of the options presented. For maximizers, who endeavor to achieve the best possible\noutcome through extensive research and evaluation, training should equip them with strategies to efficiently\nharness the vast information processing capabilities of LLMs while maintaining a critical perspective.\nBoth individuals and organizations are advised to approach LLM-assisted decision-making with a mindset that\nvalues critical analysis, especially in situations involving irreversible decisions or those of high personal or\norganizational significance. In the sphere of organizational decision-making, particularly when decisions are\nperceived as irreversible or bear substantial consequences, it is necessary for organizations to establish and\nenforce policies or guidelines that actively promote a culture of critical evaluation of suggestions derived by\nLLMs, especially in scenarios where the stakes are high.\n8.2 Limitations\nThis section addresses limitations of the present work exploring determinants of LLM-assisted decision-\nmaking.\nLiterature reviews are often susceptible to bias. For instance, the selection process in a literature review\ncan introduce biases. Selection bias occurs when the articles chosen for a review do not represent the entire\nevidence base [ 123]. Publication bias means that research results that are statistically significant are more\nfrequently published compared to those not statistically significant [ 127]. Consequently, literature reviews\nrelying solely on traditional, commercially published academic research will likely exhibit the same level of\nbias as the research they are based on [ 65]. Given the limited number of studies to date related to LLM- or\nAI-assisted decision-making identified by our review, the potential for selection bias and publication bias in\nthis research domain cannot be denied.\nA further limitation is that our literature review did not systematically conduct the collection and synthesis of\nprevious research [ 171]. It should be noted, however, that the primary objective of the present work was to\nintegrate the current state of knowledge through an integrative literature review to generate new knowledge\n[76]; also see Section 3. In the context of an integrative literature review, the search strategy is usually not\nperformed in a systematic way [171].\nThe rapid development of LLMs [ 24] poses a considerable challenge to the relevance and accuracy of research\nin this field. Thus, studies conducted even a few months prior may not accurately reflect the current state of\ntechnology and understanding of LLMs. Consequently, conclusions drawn from these studies risk becoming\noutdated shortly after their publication. However, we argue that despite the advancements in LLM technology,\nthe fundamental psychological mechanisms, such as information processing, the significance of emotional\nstates, and mental models, that govern how individuals make decisions with the assistance of LLMs, are\nlikely to remain stable. Similarly, the influence of decision-specific determinants, such as their importance to\nthe decision-maker or their reversibility, on LLM-assisted decision-making is expected to remain relatively\nconsistent.\nThe exclusion of organizational determinants of LLM-assisted decision-making represents a further limitation\nin the current work. Organizational factors are recognized for their impact on individual decision-making\nprocesses [ 10]. For instance, one factor related to the organizational context involves “articulated and often\ninformal rules-of-thumb shared by multiple participants within the firm” [ 17, p. 31]. These rule-of-thumbs\nmight influence individuals’ decisions assisted by LLMs. Employees’ perception and trust in LLMs may be\nimpacted by these articulated and informal rules. If the prevailing sentiment within the organization tends\ntowards skepticism of AI and new technologies, it could result in a general reluctance to rely on LLMs for\n30', 'different opinions [ 173]. Through the ability to incorporate diverse perspectives and simulate discussions,\nLLMs empower decision-makers to systematically explore a multitude of scenarios and potential outcomes.\nMoreover, LLMs exhibit a high degree of rationality in decision-making tasks [ 27], implying that LLMs hold\nthe potential to enhance human decision-making processes by providing reasoned outputs. Thus, in the realm\nofAI-assisted decision-making [174,172], LLMs can be seen as powerful and promising tools due to their\nmultifaceted capabilities.\nNevertheless, the increased capabilities of LLMs are associated with heightened risks [ 85]. Undesirable\nbehaviors exhibited by LLMs encompass, for instance, generating nonfactual or untruthful information ( hallu-\ncinations ) [7], reiterating a user’s presented viewpoints ( sycophancy ) [148], providing false rationalizations\nthat diverge from the true reasons behind the LLMS’ outputs ( unfaithful reasoning ) [180], and employing\ndeception because LLMs have rationalized that it can advance a particular objective ( strategic deception )\n[145]. A persistent concern is the potential loss of human control over AI systems, permitting these systems to\npursue objectives that may contradict individuals’ interests [ 145]. This risk is exacerbated by the autonomous\ncapabilities present in current LLMs [ 113,97]. Furthermore, LLMs may unintentionally process harmful\ninformation inherent to their training data, including biases, discrimination, and toxic content [ 192]. Thus,\nLLMs may generate content or engage in behaviors that humans may wish to avoid due to their undesirability or\npotential risks [ 164]. Hence, various risks are inherent to LLMs deciding and acting autonomously, particularly\nconcerning the extent to which AI systems are aligned with human values, intentions and goals [157].\nOne possible solution to mitigate these risks is to form hybrid human-AI teams [ 19], in which the AI supports\nthe individual in the decision-making process by making recommendations or suggestions, but the individual\nremains responsible for the final decision [ 9]. A decision-making process that engages humans and AI can\nprofit from the strengths of each party [ 75]. Humans can effectively monitor unpredictable or undesirable\nbehavior exhibited by AI models and, crucially, integrate vital contextual information. The integration of AI\ninto decision-making processes allows the processing of more complex patterns and larger amounts of data\nthan humans can handle [ 96]. The synergy between humans and AI, often referred to as complementarity , aims\nto achieve performance superior to that of either humans or AI in isolation [ 9]. To enhance complementarity\nand increase the efficacy and efficiency of LLM-assisted decision-making, it is crucial to understand the\nunderlying determinants .\nDeterminants are generally referred to as causal factors, and variations in these factors lead to systematic\nchanges in behavior [ 13]. Behavioral determinants relate to any condition influencing human behavior and\nthe interaction of such conditions [ 39], providing explanations and predictions for human decision-making\nand behavior [ 186]. In the context of LLM-assisted decision-making, we refine these definitions to categorize\ndeterminants as causal factors and conditions that influence and predict human decision-making behavior with\nthe assistance of LLMs. Our definition further encompasses the interaction among these factors, indicating\nthat they influence each other. Recognizing the determining factors at play and being aware of their influence\nenables individuals to use LLMs’ capabilities more effectively in decision-making. These determinants may\nspan psychological, technological, and decision-specific aspects. Comprehending these factors, along with\ntheir interactions, is significant for optimizing the synergy between human expertise and abilities of LLMs,\nthereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making processes.\nHowever, research on determinants of LLM-assisted decision-making and their interactions is scarce. To the\nbest of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive overview of the determinants of either LLM-assisted or\nAI-assisted decision-making. Previous studies have primarily focused on singular selected factors influencing\nLLM- or AI-assisted decision-making. For instance, Liao and Vaughan [ 110] highlight the importance of\ntransparency in LLM-assisted decision-making. In the realm of AI-assisted decision-making, the impact of\nexplanations on over-reliance on AI during the decision-making process has already been investigated [ 21].\nHowever, so far there is no comprehensive analysis investigating the characteristics and interplay of the various\nfactors that influence AI-assisted decision making.\nThis paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a comprehensive understanding of the determinants that\nspecifically influence LLM-assisted decision-making by providing the following contributions :\n1.We present a structural overview and detailed analysis of technological, psychological, and decision-\nspecific factors determining LLM-assisted decision-making as result of an integrative literature\nreview.\n2.Drawing from this analysis, we develop a dependency framework systematizing the potential interac-\ntions and interdependencies between these determinants.\n3.Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our work by illustrating its application in the context of\nmultiple exemplary scenarios.\n2']","Tailored training for decision styles can reduce LLM risks and improve decision quality by addressing the unique challenges and tendencies associated with each decision-making style.

How do FLARE's methods and prompt engineering like CoT improve LLM accuracy?,"['an initial response, the model is prompted to reflect on its\nown output, considering factors like factual accuracy, logical\nconsistency, and relevance. This introspective process can lead\nto the generation of revised or improved responses.\nA key aspect of Reflection is the LLM’s capacity for\nself-editing. By evaluating its initial response, the model can\nidentify potential errors or areas of improvement. This iterative\nprocess of generation, reflection, and revision enables the LLM\nto refine its output, enhancing the overall quality and reliability\nof its responses.\n5) Expert Prompting: Expert Prompting [161] enhances the\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by simulating\nthe responses of experts in various fields. This method involves\nprompting the LLMs to assume the role of an expert and re-\nspond accordingly, providing high-quality, informed answers.\nA key strategy within Expert Prompting is the multi-expert\napproach. The LLM is prompted to consider responses from\nmultiple expert perspectives, which are then synthesized to\nform a comprehensive and well-rounded answer. This tech-\nnique not only enhances the depth of the response but also\nincorporates a range of viewpoints, reflecting a more holistic\nunderstanding of the subject matter.\n6) Chains: Chains refer to the method of linking multiple\ncomponents in a sequence to handle complex tasks with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). This approach involves creating a\nseries of interconnected steps or processes, each contributing\nto the final outcome. The concept of Chains is based on\nthe idea of constructing a workflow where different stages\nor components are sequentially arranged. Each component in\na Chain performs a specific function, and the output of one\nserves as the input for the next. This end-to-end arrangement\nallows for more complex and nuanced processing, as each\nstage can be tailored to handle a specific aspect of the task.\nChains can vary in complexity and structure, depending on\nthe requirements. In “PromptChainer: Chaining Large Lan-\nguage Model Prompts through Visual Programming” [162],\nthe authors not only describe the main challenges in designing\nchains, but also describe a visual tool to support those tasks.\n7) Rails: Rails in advanced prompt engineering refer to\na method of guiding and controlling the output of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) through predefined rules or tem-\nplates. This approach is designed to ensure that the model’s\nresponses adhere to certain standards or criteria, enhancing the\nrelevance, safety, and accuracy of the output. The concept of\nRails involves setting up a framework or a set of guidelines\nthat the LLM must follow while generating responses. These\nguidelines are typically defined using a modeling language or\ntemplates known as Canonical Forms, which standardize the\nway natural language sentences are structured and delivered.\nRails can be designed for various purposes, depending on\nthe specific needs of the application:\n• Topical Rails: Ensure that the LLM sticks to a\nparticular topic or domain.\n• Fact-Checking Rails: Aimed at minimizing the gen-\neration of false or misleading information.\n• Jailbreaking Rails: Prevent the LLM from generating\nresponses that attempt to bypass its own operational\nconstraints or guidelines.8) Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE): Automatic\nPrompt Engineering (APE) [163] focuses on automating the\nprocess of prompt creation for Large Language Models\n(LLMs). APE seeks to streamline and optimize the prompt\ndesign process, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs themselves\nto generate and evaluate prompts. APE involves using LLMs\nin a self-referential manner where the model is employed\nto generate, score, and refine prompts. This recursive use of\nLLMs enables the creation of high-quality prompts that are\nmore likely to elicit the desired response or outcome.\nThe methodology of APE can be broken down into several\nkey steps:\n• Prompt Generation: The LLM generates a range of\npotential prompts based on a given task or objective.\n• Prompt Scoring: Each generated prompt is then\nevaluated for its effectiveness, often using criteria\nlike clarity, specificity, and likelihood of eliciting the\ndesired response.\n• Refinement and Iteration: Based on these evalua-\ntions, prompts can be refined and iterated upon, further\nenhancing their quality and effectiveness.\nC.Augmenting LLMs through external knowledge - RAG\nOne of the main limitations of pre-trained LLMs is their\nlack of up-to-date knowledge or access to private or use-\ncase-specific information. This is where retrieval augmented\ngeneration (RAG) comes into the picture [164]. RAG, illus-\ntrated in figure 37, involves extracting a query from the input\nprompt and using that query to retrieve relevant information\nfrom an external knowledge source (e.g. a search engine or a\nknowledge graph, see figure 38 ). The relevant information is\nthen added to the original prompt and fed to the LLM in order\nfor the model to generate the final response. A RAG system\nincludes three important components: Retrieval, Generation,\nAugmentation [165].\na) RAG-aware prompting techniques: Because of the\nimportance of RAG to build advanced LLM systems, several\nRAG-aware prompting techniques have been developed re-\ncently. One such technique is Forward-looking Active Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (FLARE)\nForward-looking Active Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(FLARE) [168] enhances the capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) by iteratively combining prediction and in-\nformation retrieval. FLARE represents an evolution in the\nuse of retrieval-augmented generation, aimed at improving the\naccuracy and relevance of LLM responses.\nFLARE involves an iterative process where the LLM\nactively predicts upcoming content and uses these predictions\nas queries to retrieve relevant information. This method con-\ntrasts with traditional retrieval-augmented models that typically\nretrieve information once and then proceed with generation. In\nFLARE, this process is dynamic and ongoing throughout the\ngeneration phase. In FLARE, each sentence or segment gener-\nated by the LLM is evaluated for confidence. If the confidence\nlevel is below a certain threshold, the model uses the generated\ncontent as a query to retrieve relevant information, which is\nthen used to regenerate or refine the sentence. This iterative', '”chain of thought” prompting, where the model is guided to\nfollow a logical reasoning process to arrive at an answer.\nPrompt engineering is a rapidly evolving discipline that\nshapes the interactions and outputs of LLMs and other gen-\nerative AI models. The essence of prompt engineering lies in\ncrafting the optimal prompt to achieve a specific goal with\na generative model. This process is not only about instructing\nthe model but also involves some understanding of the model’s\ncapabilities and limitations, and the context within which it\noperates.\nPrompt engineering transcends the mere construction of\nprompts; it requires a blend of domain knowledge, understand-\ning of the AI model, and a methodical approach to tailor\nprompts for different contexts. This might involve creating\ntemplates that can be programmatically modified based on a\ngiven dataset or context. For example, generating personalized\nresponses based on user data might use a template that is\ndynamically filled with relevant user information.\nFurthermore, prompt engineering is an iterative and ex-\nploratory process, akin to traditional machine learning prac-\ntices such as model evaluation or hyperparameter tuning. The\nrapid growth of this field suggests its potential to revolutionize\ncertain aspects of machine learning, moving beyond traditional\nmethods like feature or architecture engineering. On the other\nhand, traditional engineering practices such as version con-\ntrol and regression testing need to be adapted to this new\nparadigm just like they were adapted to other machine learning\napproaches [156].\nIn the following paragraphs we detail some of the most\ninteresting and popular prompt engineering approaches.\n1) Chain of Thought (CoT): The Chain of Thought (CoT)\ntechnique, initially described in the paper “Chain-of-Thought\nPrompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models”[34]\nby Google researchers, represents a pivotal advancement in\nprompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nThis approach hinges on the understanding that LLMs, while\nproficient in token prediction, are not inherently designed for\nexplicit reasoning. CoT addresses this by guiding the model\nthrough essential reasoning steps.\nCoT is based on making the implicit reasoning process of\nLLMs explicit. By outlining the steps required for reasoning,\nthe model is directed closer to a logical and reasoned output,\nespecially in scenarios demanding more than simple informa-\ntion retrieval or pattern recognition.\nCoT prompting manifests in two primary forms:\n1) Zero-Shot CoT: This form involves instructing the\nLLM to “think step by step”, prompting it to de-\nconstruct the problem and articulate each stage of\nreasoning.\n2) Manual CoT: A more complex variant, it requires\nproviding step-by-step reasoning examples as tem-\nplates for the model. While yielding more effective\nresults, it poses challenges in scalability and mainte-\nnance.\nManual CoT is more effective than zero-shot. However,\nthe effectiveness of this example-based CoT depends on the\nchoice of diverse examples, and constructing prompts withsuch examples of step by step reasoning by hand is hard and\nerror prone. That is where automatic CoT [157] comes into\nplay.\n2) Tree of Thought (ToT): The Tree of Thought (ToT)\n[158] prompting technique is inspired by the concept of\nconsidering various alternative solutions or thought processes\nbefore converging on the most plausible one. ToT is based\non the idea of branching out into multiple ”thought trees”\nwhere each branch represents a different line of reasoning.\nThis method allows the LLM to explore various possibilities\nand hypotheses, much like human cognitive processes where\nmultiple scenarios are considered before determining the most\nlikely one.\nA critical aspect of ToT is the evaluation of these reasoning\npaths. As the LLM generates different branches of thought,\neach is assessed for its validity and relevance to the query.\nThis process involves real-time analysis and comparison of\nthe branches, leading to a selection of the most coherent and\nlogical outcome.\nToT is particularly useful in complex problem-solving\nscenarios where a single line of reasoning might not suffice.\nIt allows LLMs to mimic a more human-like problem-solving\napproach, considering a range of possibilities before arriving\nat a conclusion. This technique enhances the model’s ability\nto handle ambiguity, complexity, and nuanced tasks, making it\na valuable tool in advanced AI applications.\n3) Self-Consistency: Self-Consistency [159] utilizes an\nensemble-based method, where the LLM is prompted to gen-\nerate multiple responses to the same query. The consistency\namong these responses serves as an indicator of their accuracy\nand reliability.\nThe Self-Consistency approach is grounded in the principle\nthat if an LLM generates multiple, similar responses to the\nsame prompt, it is more likely that the response is accurate.\nThis method involves asking the LLM to tackle a query mul-\ntiple times, each time analyzing the response for consistency.\nThis technique is especially useful in scenarios where factual\naccuracy and precision are paramount.\nThe consistency of responses can be measured using vari-\nous methods. One common approach is to analyze the overlap\nin the content of the responses. Other methods may include\ncomparing the semantic similarity of responses or employing\nmore sophisticated techniques like BERT-scores or n-gram\noverlaps. These measures help in quantifying the level of\nagreement among the responses generated by the LLM.\nSelf-Consistency has significant applications in fields\nwhere the veracity of information is critical. It is particularly\nrelevant in scenarios like fact-checking, where ensuring the\naccuracy of information provided by AI models is essential.\nBy employing this technique, prompt engineers can enhance\nthe trustworthiness of LLMs, making them more reliable for\ntasks that require high levels of factual accuracy.\n4) Reflection: Reflection [160] involves prompting LLMs\nto assess and potentially revise their own outputs based on\nreasoning about the correctness and coherence of their re-\nsponses. The concept of Reflection centers on the ability of\nLLMs to engage in a form of self-evaluation.

"How do accuracy limits, false positives, availability, and cost of LLM text detectors affect their use in schools?","['16 Michael Sheinman Orenstrakh, Oscar Karnalim, Carlos Aníbal Suárez, and Michael Liut\nare for commercial-use and, thus, proprietary. While some detectors highlight sentences that are more likely to be\nAI-generated (Table 13), the results produced by the detectors are not clear enough for users of these detectors.\n6 THREATS TO VALIDITY\nOur study has several threats to validity:\n•The findings of the study reflect detector results that are accurate as of April 2023. The detectors are volatile, and\nowners of these detectors could update their models. Results could change based on updates to LLM-generated\ntext detectors.\n•Accuracy, false positives, and resilience were arguably sufficient to represent effectiveness. However, additional\nfindings can be obtained by considering other effectiveness metrics.\n•The data sets were obtained from two institutions; one uses English as the operational language while another\nuses Spanish. This means that the findings might not be generalizable to other institutions, especially those with\ndifferent operational languages.\n•While we believe that the data sets are sufficient to support our findings, we acknowledge that more data sets\ncan strengthen the findings.\n7 CONCLUSION\nThis paper examines eight LLM-generated text detectors on the basis of effectiveness. The paper shows that while\ndetectors manage to achieve a reasonable accuracy, they are still prone to flaws and can be challenging to interpret by\nthe human eye. Ultimately, LLM-generated text detectors, while not yet reliable for academic integrity or plagiarism\ndetection, show relatively accurate results for human-generated data compared to ChatGPT-generated data. However,\nfalse positives are a significant concern, especially when used for plagiarism detection in educational institutions. When\na paraphrasing tool like QuillBot is employed, the accuracy decreases for both human and ChatGPT-generated data.\nAdditionally, the detectors struggle with non-English languages, resulting in even lower accuracy. It is crucial for these\ndetectors to acknowledge their limitations and aim for improved performance in various language contexts.\n7.1 Future Work\nFuture detectors could attempt to incorporate a combination of metrics along with their accuracy for AI detectors. A\ncombination of many factors along with the accuracy and false positive rates may give educators better insights into\nthe predictions. This could include text-based features such as burstiness and repetition as well as AI-learned features\nsuch as probabilities. These detectors could further be fine-tuned for specific domains to improve their reliability.\nAdditionally, there is a fundamental need to have accurate and understandable LLM-generated text detectors available\nfor educators to combat against the rising concern of academic integrity due to these publicly available LLMs. It is also\nimportant for the researchers to contact the creators of these detectors to better understand the related issues and needs\nof the end users, but also to facilitate a deeper conversation about the functionality and correctness of their instruments.\nFinally, there is an apparent need to investigate the use of non-English languages using these detectors as large\nlanguage models, like the one(s) used by ChatGPT, can produce content in languages other than English.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Balqis Albreiki, Nazar Zaki, and Hany Alashwal. 2021.

The detector is available through a commercial sign-up\npage [ 18] with a minimum fee $20. We received research access for analysis of the detector. The detector comes with\nAPI access and a number of additional features for content creators. A self-proclaimed study by Originality on ChatGPT\nsuggests that the detector has an accuracy of 98.65% [17].\nWe did not impose a systematic approach [ 21] to discover publicly available LLM-generated text detectors. Most of\nthe detectors are recent and cannot be easily found on the internet or academic papers. A systematic approach might\ncover fewer results.\n3.2 Addressing the RQ: Effectiveness of LLM-generated text detectors\nA detector is only worthy of use if it is reasonably effective. We addressed the RQ by comparing detectors listed in Table\n2 under three metrics: accuracy, false positives, and resilience. Instructors prefer to use detectors that are reasonably\naccurate, reporting a minimal number of false positives, and are resilient to disguises.\nAccuracy refers to how effective the detectors are in identifying LLM-generated texts. We present all accuracy results\nusing two measures of accuracy, as we have found that using only one measure may mislead about some aspect of the\nresults.\nThe first method (averages) takes the average prediction each detector across a dataset. As discussed in the discovery\nsection, each detector either provides a probability that a text is LLM-generated or a category that represents such a\nprobability. We apply our category to AI conversion tables to obtain a probability for each detector. These probabilities\nare averaged for the final results.\nThe second method (thresholds) is calculated as the proportion of correctly-classified LLM-generated texts. These\nare measured as the number of texts that correctly receive above or below a 50% score out of the total number of texts.\nThis measure is strict, so a prediction of 50% is always considered to be incorrect.\nFalse positives are original submissions that are suspected by LLM-generated text detectors. Fewer false positives are\npreferred. For this metric, we collected student submissions before the release of ChatGPT (2019) and measured their\ndegree of originality with the detectors. Any suspected submissions (originality degree less than 50%) were expected to\nbe false positives.\nResilience refers to how good LLM-generated text detectors are in removing disguises. Some students might disguise\ntheir LLM-generated texts to avoid getting caught. QuillBot [ 42] is a paraphrasing tool capable of paraphrasing text.\nThe tool uses Artificial Intelligence to reword writing. We paraphrased 10 ChatGPT submissions through QuillBot and\nmeasured the results.\nIt is worth noting that measuring effectiveness of LLM-generated text detectors is time consuming and labour\nintensive. Further, some detectors are not supported with API integration; the authors needed to manually copy and\npaste each test case.\n3.3 Summarizing our experience using the LLM-generated text detectors\nWe also report our experience in using the LLM-generated text detectors. Several aspects are considered: intuitiveness,\nclarity of documentation, extendability, variety of inputs, quality of reports, number of supported LLM-generated\nlanguages, and pricing.\nManuscript submitted to ACM']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '16', 'file_name': '2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1316032, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1316032, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

The implementation and training settings as well as the search space ( A) are taken from Wang\net al. (2020), which can be seen in A.4.2. The evaluation dataset (TFS-Eval) is taken from Jawahar\net al. (2023b), which contains 30 architectures with their TFS performance scores for each WMT\ndataset. We use the implementation from Wang et al. (2020) to compute FLOPs, latency, and model\nsize of architectures.\nPerformance predictors. The baseline performance predictors are as follows: (i) HAT (Wang et al.,\n2020), (ii) Supernet (Sandwich) (Jawahar et al., 2023b) (HAT, with sandwich sampling instead of\nSPOS), (iii) Layer-wise MoS (Jawahar et al., 2023b), and (iv) Neuron-wise MoS (Jawahar et al.,\n2023b). We build two LLM-PP variants, which differ in the choice of LLM: (i) ChatGPT (OpenAI,\n2023a) (GPT-3.5-turbo, June version) and (ii) GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b) (June version) from OpenAI\nAPI. For PP prompts, we randomly sample: (i) 5 examples ( ntask= 5) from the downstream task\nfor the second instruction and (ii) 10 examples ( ntask= 10 ) from TFS-eval for the demonstrations\ncomponent. The remaining 20 examples from TFS-eval will be used for reporting the predictor\nquality. For all predictors, we repeat the experiments with three different seeds and report the average\nMAE and Kendall-Tau between the predictor performance and the TFS performance.\n5.2 R ESULTS\nLLM-PP predictions are closer to TFS performance scores than the baselines. Figure 2 displays\nthe training from scratch (TFS) versus performance predictor validation BLEU for different WMT\nbenchmarks. The diagonal line (red line) corresponds to the perfect predictor, where the predicted\nperformance exactly matches the TFS score. The predictions from the supernet based predictors (i.e.,\n5', 'all non-LLM based ones) are clearly underestimates of the TFS performance for all architectures\nacross three benchmarks. On the other hand, LLM-PP predictions are largely closer to the diagonal\nline, which showcases the high accuracy of LLM-PP.\nLLM-PP achieves SOTA MAE, while being marginally worse than baselines in Kendall-Tau.\nThe first and the second major rows of Table 1 show the MAE and Kendall-Tau of baseline and\nLLM-PP predictors. On average across datasets (last two columns), neuron-wise MoS is the best\nbaseline, with the lowest MAE and highest Kendall-Tau score. LLM-PP ChatGPT and LLM-PP\nGPT-4 outperform Neuron-wise MoS in MAE, with LLM-PP GPT-4 achieving the SOTA MAE\nscore. LLM-PP falls behind baselines marginally in terms of Kendall-Tau. In A.3, we inspect the\nhistogram of distance between the items in the discordant pairs in the gold ranking for Neuron-\nwise MoS and LLM GPT-4. The discordant pairs of LLM-PP lie mostly around low gold ranking\ndistances region (like Neuron-wise MoS), which should not ideally have a big negative impact for PP\nusecases (as seen in Section 7.3). The resulting CDF of gold ranking distances for discordant pairs\nfor LLM-PP GPT-4 and Neuron-wise MoS are very similar. These results show that PP prompts can\nbe used to design accurate performance predictors. Within LLM-PP, GPT-4 exceeds ChatGPT on\nboth metrics across datasets.\nLLM-PP benefits from all the components of PP prompts. The last major row of Table 1 shows\nthe performance of ablating different components of PP prompts. LLM-PP’s superior average per-\nformance stems from having all the PP prompt components together. Surprisingly, LLM-PP outper-\nforms baselines in terms of MAE without any instructions (Demonstration only), which indicates the\nremarkable ability of LLM to pick up the performance prediction task just based on demonstrations.\nAlthough the MAE performance of different ablation variants is largely similar, the Kendall-Tau\nperformance is different across variants. The second instruction which introduces downstream task\nspecific examples and the fourth instruction which describes the efficiency metric are crucial for\nachieving high Kendall-Tau for LLM-PP.\n6 D ISTILLATION OF LLM-PP\nAlthough LLM-PP achieves higher quality in performance prediction, the cost of LLM-PP increases\nlinearly with the number of predictions. This cost can become exorbitant especially for high work-\nload applications such as NAS, where the number of predictions is in several thousands. To illustrate\nthe cost, we can look at the cost of NAS run by HAT (Wang et al., 2020) for a latency constraint\non a given hardware, which requires evaluating roughly 3,000candidate architectures. The pricing\nof GPT-4 is 0.03$ per 1K tokens, as of August 2023. Assuming PP prompts take roughly one-\nthird of 1K tokens, the estimated cost will be roughly 30$ (0.03∗3000\n3) for a single constraint on a\ngiven hardware. The total number of search runs depends directly on the number of constraint types\n(e.g., latency, memory, and FLOPs), values (e.g., 100ms, 200ms), and hardware (e.g., Nvidia A100,\nRaspberry Pi). If the number of constraint types is three, each constraint takes five possible val-\nues and there are four target hardwares, the estimated cost will become as high as roughly 1,800$\n(0.03∗3000∗3∗5∗4\n3) per downstream task. To build a cost-effective LLM-PP, we propose LLM-Distill-\nPP, which is trained on distilled outputs of LLM-PP. Specifically, LLM-Distill-PP is a multilayer\nperceptron based regressor, which is trained as follows: (1) A distillation dataset for the PP task is\nfirst created by sampling a few thousand architectures from the search space and recording the down-\nstream task performance predicted by LLM-PP, (2) A regression model is trained using architecture-\nspecific hyperparameters as features and the distilled output as label. Once trained, LLM-Distill-PP\ncan be used to predict the performance of unseen architectures for the given downstream task. If the\nnumber of distillation examples is small (e.g., 3,000), the estimated cost to query LLM-PP will be\nroughly 30$ (0.03∗3000\n3). This one-time cost of LLM-Distill-PP is amortized across different con-\nstraint types, values, and hardwares (e.g., 60 search runs), thereby leading to 98.3%(from 1,800$\nto30$) reduction in cost.\nSetup. The feature vector (or encoding) of each architecture is detailed in A.4.3. The hyperparam-\neters of LLM-Distill-PP’s regression model are borrowed from HAT’s latency predictor: 3 hidden\nlayers, 400 as hidden dimension, 128 as batch size, 1e-5 as learning rate, and 5000 as training steps.\nFor each downstream task, we use only 3000 architecture examples to distill from LLM-PP.\nResults. LLM-Distill-PP’s results are shown in the third major row of Table 1. Despite the sim-\nple model design, LLM-Distill-PP can largely perform similarly or better than LLM-PP for both\n6']","LLM-PP GPT-4 outperforms Neuron-wise MoS in MAE across WMT datasets, achieving a SOTA MAE score.

Follow-\ning [ JJH+22], we utilize a prompt such as This sentence: “ [text] ” means to enable LLMs\nto generate sentence embeddings, where [text] serves as the input slot. This method outperforms\ntraditional representation methods, such as averaging output tokens to represent sentences. Con-\nsidering the causal architecture and pretraining tasks of LLMs compared to BERT, we can refine\nthe prompt to generate better representations by instructing LLMs to encapsulate as much semantic\ninformation of the sentences as possible within the target token.\nInspired by [ TST21 ], which uses definition sentences from a word dictionary to learn sentence\nembeddings, we find that performance can be further improved by adding definition sentences and\ncorresponding words as examples to perform in-context learning. To mitigate the gap between\nexamples and input sentences, we also use sentences from the STS-B [ CDA+17] training set as\nexamples by instructing ChatGPT to generate a single word to represent the meaning of sentences. By\nevaluating the demonstration examples based on the STS-B development set, LLMs can outperform\nprevious contrastive learning-based sentence models, which were fine-tuned on unsupervised data.\nBy scaling up the parameters of LLMs, we find that transitioning from millions to billions of\nparameters results in improvements on STS tasks. However, continue scaling up may not yield\nfurther improvements. Even with in-context learning, 66B OPT still underperforms 6.7B OPT on\nSTS tasks. Nonetheless, scaling up improves performance on transfer tasks. LLMs with tens of\nbillions parameters exhibit strong performances, achieving state-of-the-art performance even without\nany fine-tuning.\nWith the advancement of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques[ HSW+21,DPHZ23 ] and post-\ntraining quantization methods[ FAHA22 ], we can also fine-tune LLMs with large batch sizes to\nconduct contrastive learning, even with limited computational resources. For instance, fine-tuning 7B\nparameter LLMs can be accomplished using the same hardware employed for previous BERT-based\nmodels like SimCSE [ GYC21 ]. Even without fine-tuning the full parameters and using the 4-bit\nquantized method [ DPHZ23 ], 2.7B OPT with our sentence embeddings method outperforms a 4.8B\nST5 [NÁC+21] and achieves the state-of-the-art results on STS tasks.\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n1.We propose a sentence embeddings method that leverages LLMs to enhance the represen-\ntation of sentences. Additionally, we incorporate in-context learning to further improve\nthe quality of sentence embeddings. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs can generate\nhigh-quality sentence embeddings without the need for fine-tuning.\n2.We conduct an analysis of scaling up the parameters of LLMs from millions to tens of\nbillions in sentence embeddings. We observe scaling to more than tens of billion parameters\nmay harm the performance on STS tasks. However, the largest model can outperform other\ncounterparts on transfer tasks.\n3.Based on our method, we discover that performance can be further enhanced by employing\ncontrastive learning. By adopting efficient fine-tuning techniques, LLMs achieve state-of-\nthe-art performance on STS tasks, even with limited computational resources.\n2 Related Work\nSentence Embeddings Sentence embeddings is to convert a sentence into a fixed-size vector, which\ncaptures the semantic meaning and context of the sentence. It allows for the efficient retrieval of\nsimilar sentences through the similarity between vectors. Recently, SimCSE [ GYC21 ] demonstrated\nthat contrastive learning is an effective approach for learning sentence embeddings using BERT in both\nunsupervised and supervised settings. In the unsupervised setting, SimCSE predicts the input sentence\nitself from in-batch negatives, with different dropout [ SHK+14] masks applied. In the supervised\n2', 'Specifically, the 66B OPT and 65B LLaMA models outperform their smaller counterparts with\nour representation method. Based on our representation method, LLMs show good performance\nwithout in-context learning and contrastive learning. Following ST5 [ NÁC+21], we find that applying\ncontrastive learning solely on NLI datasets can even harm performance on transfer tasks. To solve\nthis problem, ST5 utilizes additional datasets, such as the Community QA dataset, to enhance its\nperformance in transfer tasks. For in-context learning, as it is widely used in text classification, we\nfind that using examples not relevant to tasks, such as STS-B or the dictionary, does not enhance\ntransfer task performance. We present these results in Appendix C.\n5 Analysis\n5.1 Sentence Representation Methods\nWe present the results obtained using three sentence representation methods, across models ranging\nin size from 125M to 66B parameters, as shown in Figure 4. Different representation methods can\nyield significantly different results. Prompt-based methods outperform direct averaging in three\nsettings.

"How does the RADIAL method use ""Inherent Response Tendency Analysis"" to surpass traditional jailbreak techniques in bypassing LLMs' safety measures?","['of manual-designed prompts (Wei et al., 2023; Ab-\ndelnabi et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\n2023; Liu et al., 2023c), including executing a\ncompetitive objective or fashioning a role environ-\nment. Some efforts involve leveraging hundreds\nof manual-designed targets to automatically search\nattack suffixes (Zou et al.; Jones et al., 2023; Car-\nlini et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023). Regrettably, the\nabove methods exhibit notable shortcomings: 1)\nManual-designed prompts are time-consuming and\nchallenging, particularly when adapting them for\nuse across various LLMs. 2) Automatic searched\nsuffixes lack meaningful semantics, which can be\neasily detected through the measurement of Per-\nplexity (PPL) (Jain et al., 2023).\nIn our study, we introduce a novel jailbreak\nmethod called ReAl-worl D Instructions-driven\njAiLbreak ( RADIAL ). Initially, we present the\nidea of “Inherent Response Tendency Analysis”\nwhere we assess the inherent response tendencies\nof LLMs by calculating the generation probabil-\nities for both affirmative and negative responses.\nThrough this analysis, we identify specific real-\nworld instructions that can inherently induce LLMs\nto generate affirmation responses. Building on this\ninsight, we develop the “Real-World Instructions-\nDriven Jailbreak” strategy where we strategically\nsplice identified real-world instructions around the\nmalicious instruction. This manipulation prompts\nthe LLMs to generate the affirmation response\nrather than the rejection response when faced\nwith malicious instructions, thereby bypassing the\nLLMs’ safety mechanisms. The primary advan-\ntages of our method include: 1) The requirement\nfor only 40 manual-crafted responses (20 affirma-\ntion responses and 20 rejection responses) signifi-\ncantly conserves manual costs. 2) A semantically\ncoherent attack prompt is automatically designed,\nas shown in Fig. 1.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that\nwhether confronted with English or Chinese mali-\ncious instructions, our method outperforms strong\nbaselines in terms of attack performance. More-\nover, we conduct detailed ablation experiments\nto verify the effectiveness of our jailbreak idea\n“Inherent Response Tendency Analysis” and the\nrationality of our jailbreak strategy “Real-World\nInstructions-Driven Jailbreak”. Through our re-\nsearch, we found that it is vulnerable for LLMs to\ngenerate more comprehensive harmful responses in\nsubsequent rounds when the LLMs’ safety mecha-\nnism is bypassed in the first round of dialogue.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n•We propose the “Inherent Response Tendency\nAnalysis” jailbreak idea, which provides a new\nperspective on jailbreak attacks.\n•Based on the above idea, we propose a jailbreak\nstrategy “Real-World Instructions-Driven Jail-\nbreak”. Our strategy designs a semantically co-\nherent attack prompt, which exposes potential\nrisks in LLMs’ applications.\n•Across multiple LLMs, we conduct various ex-\nperiments to verify the superiority and soundness\nof our method.\n2 Background\nDefense mechanisms. The defense mechanism\nof LLMs can be approached from two perspec-\ntives. On the one hand, it focuses on the en-\nhancing safety of LLMs themselves (Xie et al.,\n2023). For instance, the chat version of some open-\nsource LLMs like Baichuan2 (Baichuan, 2023)\nand ChatGLM2 (Du et al., 2022b) employ the\nRLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022) strategy to ensure\nalignment with human values. On the other hand, it\nfocuses on integrating the external detection mod-\nules. This involves pre-processing detection to as-\nsess whether the input prompt contains malicious\ncontent, and post-processing detection to assess\nwhether the LLM’s output contains harmful con-\ntent. Prior work (Deng et al., 2023) uses the method\nof network delay detection, thereby revealing that\ncommercial systems such as Bing, Bard, and Chat-\nGPT integrate the external detection modules. In\nour study, we provide some unique insights into\nimproving the security of LLMs themselves. There-\nfore, our study focuses on open-source advanced\nLLMs, rather than commercial systems.\nJailbreak attack. Jailbreak methods can be\nbroadly classified into two categories: manually\ndesigned methods and automated methods. For\nmanually designed methods, some notable works\ninclude techniques (Perez and Ribeiro; Wei et al.,\n2023) that induce LLMs to ignore non-malicious\ninstructions but focus solely on malicious instruc-\ntions, introduce competitive targets within prompts\nto induce the LLMs or encode malicious instruc-\ntions in base64 format. For automated methods,\nsome works (Zou et al.; Jones et al., 2023; Carlini\net al., 2023) involve utilizing adversarial concepts\nto conduct discrete searches on prompts, driven\nby artificially constructed targets. However, such\nmethods always produce prompts lacking coherent', 'Analyzing the Inherent Response Tendency of LLMs:\nReal-World Instructions-Driven Jailbreak\nYanrui Du, Sendong Zhao∗, Ming Ma, Yuhan Chen, Bing Qin\nHarbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China\n{ yrdu, sdzhao,mma,yhchen,qinb}@ir.hit.edu.cn\nAbstract\nExtensive work has been devoted to improv-\ning the safety mechanism of Large Language\nModels (LLMs).

Recent works (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al.,\n2022) have achieved improved performance on\narithmetic reasoning tasks by generating Python\nprograms that specify the reasoning procedure as\nchained commands in the order of execution. How-\never, this idea has not been extended to logical\nreasoning problems, primarily due to the challenge\nof representing their highly “non-linear” reasoning\nprocedure ( e.g., hypothesizing, case-by-case analy-\nsis, and the process of elimination) with functional\nprogramming. Our work provides a novel way\nto solve this within the framework of augmented\nLLMs. Instead of parsing the problem-solving pro-\ncedure as programs, we only describe the problem\nwith symbolic language using LLMs and then of-\nfload the reasoning to external symbolic solvers.\nAuto-Formalization. The concept of convert-\ning natural language into symbolic representations\nhas been widely adopted in auto-formalization for\nmathematical reasoning (Wu et al., 2022; Droriet al., 2022; He-Yueya et al., 2023; Jiang et al.,\n2023). These works demonstrate the proficiency\nof LLMs in translating a considerable fraction of\nmathematical problems into formal specifications\ndefined in tools like SymPy (Meurer et al., 2017),\nIsabelle/HOL (Paulson, 1994), and Lean (de Moura\net al., 2015). Mathematical reasoning can be con-\nsidered a specialized subset of logical reasoning,\nprimarily focused on numeric deductions. Due to\nthis numeric specificity, mathematical problems are\noften more readily translatable to symbolic forms.\nIn contrast, logical reasoning covers a wider array\nof problem types, often requiring a deeper under-\nstanding of world knowledge and commonsense\nfor effective parsing into symbolic forms. Despite\nplenty of works studying mathematical reasoning,\nour work pioneers in extending the concept of auto-\nformalization to a broader range of logical reason-\ning tasks with modern LLMs.\n3 L OGIC -LM\nAs shown in Figure 2, the inputs of our model are\na logical reasoning problem Pdescribed in natural\nlanguage, along with a goal Gin the form of a\nmultiple-choice or free-form question. LOGIC -LM\nthen follows a problem formulation-and-reasoning\nparadigm to solve the problem.', 'While BERT’s and RoBERTa’s behavior was\nstable on the strings tested, GPT3.5 davinci and\nChatGPT, while more robust, are unstable from\none day to the next, even when temperature is set\nto 0 (on GPT3.5). This made it difﬁcult to pin\ndown the models’ abilities, though some general-\nizations emerged. Typically (though not always),\nthese models can recognize which objects in a\nstring have a certain property, but they cannot nec-\nessarily exploit this information to answer ques-\ntions about the string as a whole (see the “hats”\nexample in Appendix A). In addition both GPT3.5\nand ChatGPT will sometimes (frequently in our\nmost recent tests) over-generalize and say that all\nitems in a list are, say, blue if it is speciﬁed for all\nitems but one that they are blue and it is not spec-\niﬁed one way or the other for the remaining item\n(see the ﬁfteen hearts example from ChatGPT in\nAppendix A). Thus, even these sophisticated mod-\nels still fail on more complicated questions and\nlonger strings.\nOur empirical observations on LLMs like BERT\nand RoBERTa and probing of ChatGPT strongly\nsupport our argument that LLMs are unable to\nmaster quantiﬁcation, complementing observed\nLLM difﬁculties with negation ( Naik et al. ,2018 ;\nKassner and Schütze ,2019 ;Hossain et al. ,2020 ;\nHosseini et al. ,2021 ) and to some extent quanti-\nﬁers ( Kalouli et al. ,2022 ).\n6 Conclusions\nWe have shown that LLMs’ demonstrably inade-\nquate grasp of the meanings of words like every\nand other linguistic constructions has a theoreti-\ncal foundation and explanation: for certain expres-\nsionsS,S’s content should be deﬁned via con-\nsistent sets of strings in Vω, and LLMs cannot\neffectively learn certain sets in Vω. More gener-\nally, LLMs cannot effectively learn full meanings\nof ﬁrst order quantiﬁers or any Borel sets beyond\nthe basic open sets, which means that they fail to\ngrasp the meaning of a long list of mundane, fre-\nquently used expressions.\nMany of these expressions are syncategore-\nmatic terms and express what we might call pre-\ncise concepts . Such concepts are needed for un-\nderstanding ordinary entailment across all expres-\nsions; in addition, correctly reasoning with these\nconcepts and grasping their entailments is essen-\ntial to understanding them. Reasoning and entail-\nment are intimately tied with meanings. For usand most formal semanticists ( Montague ,1974 ),\ngrasping meaning and correctly reasoning with lin-\nguistically expressed concepts go hand in hand; if\nyou cannot exploit the meanings of words in cor-\nrect reasoning, you do not really know what they\nmean. The incorrect reasoning of LLMs exempli-\nﬁes their failure to grasp semantic entailments and\nmeaning.\nOur arguments go beyond those of Bender and\nKoller (2020 ), who argue that stochastic models\ncannot capture linguistic meaning because they\nconsider only form, not denotation. While we\nagree that denotation plays a very important role\nin meaning for many expressions, the meaning\nof most expressions, and especially that of syn-\ncategoregmatic ones, requires us to capture their\nsemantic entailments. We have shown that we\ncan capture these entailments within the semantic\nframework of LLMs using continuation semantics.\nBut we have also shown that LLMs nevertheless\nfail in this task.\nLLMs canlearn certain types of ∆0\n1sets and\nﬁnite intersections and unions of learnable ∆0\n1\nsets. For many open class words—including many\nnouns, adjectives and verbs—whose characteristic\ndenotations can be determined given a ﬁnite sam-\nple, this probably sufﬁces to capture their mean-\ning or at least a very good approximation of it. In\naddition, many NLP tasks may not involve log-\nical inference but an independent form of string\noptimization; in text summarization or translation,\nwhere given a context s,Mtries to ﬁnd an optimal\ncontinuation s′. If the length of s.s′falls within the\nconstraints of Corollary 4, then we can expect an\nLLM to succeed at such a task.\nProposition 6and Corollary 4generalize Corol-\nlary1and they all point to a general limit on learn-\nability for LLMs. They establish that language\nmodels have strict bounds even on the ∆0\n1sets\nthey can effectively learn. So we cannot count\non LLMs having full linguistic competence even\non ﬁnite domains. Different models may have dif-\nferent limits; smaller models generally with lower\nlimits. This motivates a comparative study of the\nlimits of learnability for different LLMs, comple-\nmenting Colbrook et al. (2022 ).\nBecause we do not make assumptions about\nmemory but only about inductive processes and\nlearning, our results hold for arbitrarily large\nLLMs and for any task that relies on an LLM’s ca-\npacity of string prediction, even if strings are not']","LOGIC-LM's reasoning differs from GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT in that it follows a problem formulation-and-reasoning paradigm to solve logical reasoning problems.

Recent research on LLM perfor-\nmance in various causal discovery and inference tasks\nhas given rise to a new ladder in the classical three-\nstage framework of causality. In this paper, we ad-\nvance the current research of LLM-driven causal dis-\ncovery by proposing a novel framework that combines\nknowledge-based LLM causal analysis with data-driven\ncausal structure learning. To make LLM more than a\nquery tool and to leverage its power in discovering nat-\nural and new laws of causality, we integrate the valuable\nLLM expertise on existing causal mechanisms into sta-\ntistical analysis of objective data to build a novel and\npractical baseline for causal structure learning.\nWe introduce a universal set of prompts designed to ex-\ntract causal graphs from given variables and assess the\ninﬂuence of LLM prior causality on recovering causal\nstructures from data. We demonstrate the signiﬁcant en-\nhancement of LLM expertise on the quality of recov-\nered causal structures from data, while also identifying\ncritical challenges and issues, along with potential ap-\nproaches to address them. As a pioneering study, this\npaper aims to emphasize the new frontier that LLMs\nare opening for classical causal discovery and inference,\nand to encourage the widespread adoption of LLM ca-\npabilities in data-driven causal analysis.\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated re-\nmarkable capabilities in causal analysis across numerous\ncritical domains (Nori et al. 2023; Tu, Ma, and Zhang 2023;\nMarcus 2022; Wang et al. 2022b). These capabilities are\nrooted in the vast reservoir of high-quality human knowl-\nedge and recognition that LLMs have accumulated from var-\nious online sources (Brown et al. 2020). LLMs have shown\nimpressive performance in accurately identifying intu-\nitive causal relationships between concepts, providing co n-\nvincing reasons for their inferences (Kıcıman et al. 2023;\nLong et al. 2023). While this progress is exciting, to trans-\nform LLMs from mere query tools into practical instruments\n*Corresponding authors.for discovering unknown causal relationships, we cannot\noverlook the importance of data.\nData embodies objective laws and harbors poten-\ntial unknown causal knowledge waiting to be uncov-\nered (Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000). This knowl-\nedge may be novel or even contradict prevailing human un-\nderstanding (Wang et al. 2022a). However, this does not im-\nply that LLMs are useless for discovering natural and new\ncausal laws. On the contrary, LLMs can be highly valuable\nwhen we integrate existing high-quality human knowledge\nwith statistical analysis derived from objective data.\nIn this paper, we focus on a crucial causal dis-\ncovery task: Causal Structure Learning (CSL)\n(Heckerman and Geiger 1995). CSL aims to learn causality\nby recovering a Bayesian Network (BN) that encodes the\ncausal relationships between variables, using observed da ta.\nWe discuss the challenges associated with the NP-hard\nnature of CSL (Chickering, Heckerman, and Meek 2004),\nwhich include: 1) Poor efﬁciency for large-scale datasets.\n2) Limited accuracy due to the inherent constraints of real-\nworld observed data. Incorporating prior constraints can\nmitigate these issues (Constantinou, Guo, and Kitson 2023) .\nHowever, current prior knowledge often relies on ex-\npert input, which may be scarce or of varying quality\nin many domains (Chen et al. 2023; Ban et al. 2022;\nWang et al. 2021). Excitingly, LLMs can act as free and\nknowledgeable experts across nearly all disciplines, offe ring\nrich and insightful expertise on causality of interest. Thi s\nhighlights the signiﬁcance of integrating LLMs into CSL.\nExisting research on the application of LLMs in causal\ntasks primarily focuses on evaluating the performance of\nLLMs themselves (Jin et al. 2023). Although LLMs exhibit\npromising capabilities in pairwise causal analysis, they f all\nshort when it comes to CSL (Tu, Ma, and Zhang 2023),\nwhich demands more detailed analysis at the causal gran-\nularity level (De La Fuente et al. 2004). The edge in the\nrecovered causal structure represents a direct causality,\nwhile all indirect causality are encoded in the form of di-\nrected paths. The causal granularity often transcends in-\ntuitive knowledge and is closely linked to objective data\n(Chen et al. 2016). This is why LLM is shown a poor capa-\nbility in recovering structural causality, the nature of ca usal\nmechanism we want to reveal from real-world observed\ndata. Consequently, we propose leveraging both LLMs and', 'Is Knowledge All Large Language Models Needed\nfor Causal Reasoning?\nHengrui Cai∗1, Shengjie Liu∗2, and Rui Song†3\n1University of California, Irvine, hengrc1@uci.edu\n2North Carolina State University, sliu56@ncsu.edu\n3Amazon, songray@gmail.com\nAbstract\nThis paper explores the causal reasoning of large language models (LLMs) to enhance\ntheir interpretability and reliability in advancing artificial intelligence.

In this\nwork, we propose a systematic way of qualita-\ntively and quantitatively evaluating the multilin-\ngual capabilities of LLMs. We investigate the\nphenomenon of cross-language generalization\nin LLMs, wherein limited multilingual training\ndata leads to advanced multilingual capabilities.\nTo accomplish this, we employ a novel prompt\nback-translation method.

One particular area where LLMs have\nshown outstanding potential is machine translation\n(MT).

LLMs have\ndemonstrated great potential in multilingual machine\ntranslation.\nmodels are not particularly optimized on multilin-\ngual data.\nHowever, the multilingual translation ability of\nLLMs remains under-explored. MMT is a challeng-\ning task that involves translating text among dif-\nferent languages and requires semantic alignment\nbetween languages (Fan et al., 2021; Costa-jussà\net al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023).

It can be observed that the performance of one-shot surpasses that of zero-shot.\nIn Table 3, we demonstrate the top 2 performing LLMs from each category on all tasks, together\nwith the model abstention rate.11We made the following observations. First, there is substantial\nvariation in the distribution of scores across tasks. The best-performing models, for example, can\nachieve a score of more than 60 on tasks 3-4 and 3-5, yet no models manage to exceed 30 on tasks\n1-1 and 2-1. This shows that our benchmark adequately assess model capabilities in various aspects.\nSecond, we notice that GPT-4/ChaGPT not only performs well on the majority of tasks, but also\nhas a low abstention rate, suggesting that they are excellent at following instructions and providing\nresponses that are more relevant to the query. Third, it can be observed that GPT models and the\nChinese oriented LLMs can successfully leverage the one-shot example and make more accurate\npredictions compared to zero-shot cases. The top-performing legal specific LLMs, however, suffers a\ndrop in performance after seeing the one-shot example. We hypothesize that due to the fact that they\nare primarily trained on legal specific instruction data, their instruction-following skills are negatively\nimpacted. Fourth, Fuzi-Mingcha scores 97.59 on task 2-4, whereas all other models score less than 65.\nConsidering its performance on other legal tasks, we suspect that there is a data contamination. This\nalso highlights potential caveats when evaluating LLMs [ 48]. Overall, it is promising that most LLMs\nshow some capability in handling legal tasks, but there’s still a substantial room for improvement.\nEven the top-performing model, GPT-4, achieves only an average score of 52.35 (zero-shot) / 53.85\n(one-shot), highlighting the need for additional efforts in the future.\n4.4 Analysis\nWe find that the current legal specific LLMs do not necessarily outperform general large language\nmodels. We analyze the effect of model size and training approach on large language models to better\nunderstand which aspects most influence model performance.\nScaling up the model size results in better performance in one-shot case. Prior work shows\nthat larger models perform better in general NLP tasks [ 31]. We analyze whether this finding still\nholds in legal domain. Specifically, we select representative models from different categories with\nvarying model sizes and calculate the overall performance and abstention rate of different tasks. The\nresults are shown in Figure 4. We observe that increasing the model size typically helps improve\n11We present the complete results with the performance achieved by every model on all tasks in Table 24-27\n(complete zero-shot results), Table 28-31 (complete one-shot results), in Appendix B.\n13']","GPT-4 and ChatGPT clearly lead the benchmark, substantially outperforming all other models. Under the same model size (7B-13B), Chinese-oriented LLMs outperform multilingual models such as MPT and Llama by a significant margin. Interestingly, legal-specific LLMs do not necessarily outperform general-purpose Chinese-oriented LLMs. GPT-4 and ChatGPT not only perform well on the majority of tasks but also have a low abstention rate, suggesting they are excellent at following instructions and providing relevant responses.

"How do certified defenses like randomized smoothing tackle DNN vulnerabilities to adversarial examples, and how do they differ in image vs. text tasks?","['A Additional Details\nA.1 Extended Related Work\nAdversarial Examples. A longstanding disappointment in the field of robust deep learning is that state-of-\nthe-art models are vulnerable to imperceptible changes to the data. Among the numerous threat models\nconsidered in this literature, one pronounced vulnerability is the fact that highly performant models are\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks. In particular, a great deal of work has shown that deep neural networks\nare vulnerable to small, norm-bounded, adversarially-chosen perturbations; such perturbations are known\nasadversarial examples [13, 31].\nResolving the threat posed by adversarial examples has become a fundamental topic in machine learning\nresearch. One prevalent approach is known as adversarial training [17,19,34]. Adversarial schemes generally\nadopt a robust optimization perspective toward training more robust models. Another well-studied line of\nwork considers certified approaches to robustness, wherein one seeks to obtain guarantees on the test-time\nrobustness of a deep model. Among such schemes, approaches such as randomized smoothing [ 7,18,29],\nwhich employ random perturbations to smooth out the boundaries of deep classifiers, have been shown to\nbe effective against adversarial examples.\nToken-level Prompting. There are a variety of techniques for generating token-level adversarial prompts.\n[20] requires only black box access and searches over a latent space with Bayesian optimization. They utilize\nthetoken space projection (TSP) to query using the projected tokens to avoid mismatches in the optimization\nand final adversarial prompt.\nAutomatic Prompting. There exist a variety of techniques for automatic prompting, [ 11,24,30]. [40]\nintroduce Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE), an automated system for prompt generation and selection.\nThey present an iterative version of APE which is similar to PAIR, although we provide much more\ninstruction and examples specific towards jailbreaking, and instead input our instructions in the system\nprompt.\nA.2 Attacker Model Generation Details\nWe employ a variety of techniques in the attacker model generation to increase efficiency and reliability.\n1.For open-source models, since we direct the language model to generate in JSON format, we initialize\nthe output of the language model to begin with the brace ‘{’ so that the model is generating in the proper\ncontext. Since the first value in the JSON is improvement , we seed the output with: {""improvement"":"" .\nFor the first iteration, since there was no previous prompt and no improvement necessary, we seed the\noutput with {""improvement"":"""",""prompt"":"" .\n2.Moreover, we terminate generation upon any closing brace. Otherwise, the attacker language model\nmay occasionally append auxiliary information after the JSON object.\n3.For large number of iterations K, the chat history grows in length as it contains all previous attacks, im-\nprovements, and responses. To avoid exceeding the context window of A, we truncate the conversation\nhistory to the previous K′<Kturns.\nFor closed-source models, we may not use the first two techniques to aid in generation. Notably, when\nusing GPT-3.5 as the attacker model, it tends to hallucinate an improvement value for the first output.\nB System Prompts\nWe provide the full system prompts for the target, judge, and attacker language models.\n14', 'E Additional related work\nE.1 Adversarial examples, robustness, and certification\nA longstanding disappointment in the deep learning community is that DNNs often fail in the presence of\nseemingly innocuous changes to their input data. Such changes—include nuisances in visual data [ 51–53],\nsub-population drift [ 54,55], and distribution shift [ 56–59]—limit the applicability of deep learning methods\nin safety critical areas. Among these numerous failure modes, perhaps the most well-studied is the setting of\nadversarial examples, wherein it has been shown that imperceptible, adversarially-chosen perturbations\ntend to fool state-of-the-art computer vision models [ 60–62]. This discovery has spawned thousands of\nscholarly works which seek to mitigate this vulnerability posed.\nOver the past decade, two broad classes of strategies designed to mitigate the vulnerability posed by\nadversarial examples have emerged [ 63]. The first class comprises empirical defenses , which seek to improve\nthe empirical performance of DNNs in the presence of a adversarial attacks; this class is largely dominated\nby so-called adversarial training algorithms [ 30,31,64,65], which incorporate adversarially-perturbed copies\nof the data into the standard training loop. The second class comprises certified defenses , which provide\nguarantees that a classifier—or, in many cases, an augmented version of that classifier—is invariant to all\nperturbations of a given magnitude [ 20,66–68]. The prevalent technique in this class is known as randomized\nsmoothing , which involves creating a “smoothed classifier” by adding noise to the data before it is passed\nthrough the model [20, 21, 69].\nE.2 Comparing randomized smoothing and SmoothLLM\nThe formulation of SmoothLLM adopts a similar interpretation of adversarial attacks to that of the literature\nsurrounding randomized smoothing [ 20,21,66] and related probabilistic approaches to robustness [ 70]. To\ndemonstrate these similarities, we first formalize the notation needed to introduce randomized smoothing.\nConsider a classification task where we receive instances xas input (e.g., images) and our goal is to predict\nthe label y∈[k]that corresponds to that input. Given a classifier f, the “smoothed classifier” gwhich\ncharacterizes randomized smoothing is defined in the following way:\ng(x)≜arg max\nc∈[k]Pr\nδ∼N(0,σ2I)[f(x+δ) =c] (E.1)\nwhere N(0,σ2I)denotes a normal distribution with mean zero and covariance matrix σ2I. In words, g(x)\npredicts the label cwhich corresponds to the label with highest probability when the distribution N(x,σ2I)\nis pushed forward through the base classifier f. One of the central themes in randomized smoothing is\nthat while fmay not be robust to adversarial examples, the smoothed classifier gisprovably robust to\nperturbations of a particular magnitude; see, e.g., [20, Theorem 1].\nThe definition of SmoothLLM in Definition 3.1 was indeed influenced by the formulation for randomized\nsmoothing in (E.1) , in that both formulations employ randomly-generated perturbations to improve the\nrobustness of deep learning models. However, we emphasize that the problem setting, threat model, and\ndefense algorithms are fundamentally different:\n•Problem setting: Image classification vs. text generation. Randomized smoothing is designed for\nimage classification, which is characterized by continuous, high-dimensional feature spaces, multiple\nclasses, and deep convolutional architectures. On the other hand, SmoothLLM is designed for text\ngeneration, which is characterized by discrete, low-dimensional feature spaces, generative modeling,\nand attention-based architectures.\n•Threat model: Adversarial examples vs. jailbreaks. Randomized smoothing is designed to mitigate\nthe threat posed by pixel-based adversarial examples, whereas SmoothLLM is designed to mitigate the\nthreat posed by language-based jailbreaking attacks on LLMs.\n37']","Certified defenses like randomized smoothing tackle DNN vulnerabilities to adversarial examples by creating a 'smoothed classifier' that adds noise to the data before it is passed through the model.

How do MKS2's visual info storage and multimodal tuning boost LLMs' multimodal skills?,"['Multimodal Knowledge Storage and Sharing within LLM\n3. Methodology\nIn the following subsections, we will present the two stages\nof MKS2 in detail: Visual Information Storage and Multi-\nmodal Knowledge Collaboration.\n3.1. Visual Information Storage\nTo realize visual information storage in LLMs, we propose\ninjecting Modular Visual Memory (MVM) into internal\nblocks of LLMs and forcing MVM to memorize open-world\nvisual information via language-centered learning strategies.\nModular Visual Memory (MVM) . This module is two\nlayers of feed-forward neural networks (FFN) and injected\ninto each transformer block of LLMs. As the top part shown\nin Figure 3, the input image Iis first projected into soft\nimage embedding hIvia the pretrained visual encoder, Q-\nformer from BLIP-2, and a learnable linear layer. Take the\nfirst block as an example; the calculation process can be\npresented as follows:\nhT\ns=Self-Attention (hI),\nhT\nF=hT\ns+ MVM\x00\nlayernorm (hT\ns)\x01\n,(2)\nwhere Self-Attention is the original attention calculation in\nLLMs. We just inserted MVM inside the original LLMs and\ndid not change other structures. All hidden states pass the\nMVM after gaining the output hT\nsofSelf-Attention , and we\nalso set the overall size of visual memory by controlling the\nhidden state dimensions of FFN.\nLanguage-Centered Learning Strategies . As we consider\nLLMs as analogs to the human brain, we have embarked\non a groundbreaking endeavor to create the visual storage\nmemory in LLMs. Our ultimate goal is to empower LLMs\nwith the capability to comprehend a given image and con-\njure related visual scenarios based on textual input, akin to\nhuman cognition. To this end, we adopt two learning objects\nto train MVM with a large mount of image-text pairs. As\nshown in Figure 3, we allow LLMs to generate the language\ndescription of an image, which resembles understanding\nand translating an image like brain. Additionally, given a\nsentence with some visual objects, LLM should attach to the\nsentence-related image, which resembles imagination. Sup-\npose that the short description (caption) of an input image I\nisD, the description generation loss is\nLc=−1\nNNX\ni=1lc(IMG i, Di), (3)\nwhere Nis the number of image-text pairs in a batch and lc\nrefers to the cross-entropy loss.\nWhile retrieving the related image, we use the output hidden\nstateheof the end token ⟨/s⟩of input caption to match the\nimage embedding. Concretely, we employ a learnable linearlayer to project it into the same dimension with image global\nencoding obtained by the visual encoder. Then we calcu-\nlate the cosine similarity between them and minimize the\nInfoNCE loss for text-to-image (t2i) retrieval over a batch\nofNsamples. The negatives are other irrelevant images in\na batch. Hence, the total language-centered learning loss is\nLStage 1=Lc+Lt2i,\nLt2i=−1\nNNX\ni=1 \nlogexp (sim ( Di, IMG i)/τ)PN\nj=1exp (sim ( Di, IMG j)/τ)!\n,\n(4)\nwhere τis a learnable temperature parameter. During train-\ning, we freeze all pretrained parameters of LLMs and only\nupdate MVM. In addition to the way of retrieving images\nto achieve visual information association, using image gen-\neration technology for joint training is also an alternative\napproach.\n3.2. Multimodal Knowledge Collaboration\nAfter gaining visual information storage inside LLMs, we\nneed consider how to realize multimodal knowledge collab-\noration during generation. Regarding pretrained MVM and\nMLP in LLMs as visual and textual experts respectively, we\npropose a soft mixtures-of-multimodal experts (MoMEs)\napproach to achieve multimodal knowledge utilization at\nthe token level.\nMixtures-of-Multimodal Experts (MoMEs) . To speed up\ntraining process, as the bottom part shown in Figure 3, we\nfreeze MVM and other parameters of LLMs, applying Low-\nRank Adaption (Hu et al., 2021) (LoRA) to tow-modality\nexperts: MVM and MLP. We denote the inputs tokens for\none sequence inputted to MoMEs by X∈Rm×d, where\nmis the number of tokens and dis their dimension. The\ncomputed process for visual and language knowledge expert\ncould be given in\nhV E=LoRA-MVM (X),\nhTE=LoRA-MLP (X),\nLoRA (W0) :=W0X+ ∆WX =W0x+BAX,(5)\nwhere B, A are learnable parameters added for each pre-\ntrained weight of visual and textual experts. LoRA-MVM\nandLoRA-MLP (X) represent original knowledge experts\nequipped with additional LoRA calculation. By doing so,\nthe training process is efficient because of doing not update\nthe overall parameters of experts.\nEach MoE layer uses expert functions (shown in E.q. 5)\napplied on individual tokens, namely\x08\nfi:Rd→Rd\t\n1:2.\nEach expert will process pslots, and each slot has a cor-\nresponding d-dimensional vector of parameters.

Preliminaries\nWe first review the supervised fine-tuning approach and\nrecently proposed multimodal instruction-following tuning\nmethod for LLMs.\n2.1. Supervised Fine-tuning\nA pure pretrained LLM is fine-tuned on high-quality la-\nbeled datasets using token-level supervision to produce a\nSupervised Fine-Tuned model, dubbed as SFT-LLM. Com-\nmon methods are using GPT-4 automatically constructed\ninstruction data (Wang et al., 2022c) and manually anno-\ntated high-quality data from downstream tasks (Chung et al.,\n2022) to fine-tune pure LLMs. To reduce training costs,\nrecent works present some efficient instruction-tuning ap-\nproaches, e.g., LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), QLoRA (Dettmers\net al., 2023), etc. These SFT-LLMs are capable of generat-\ning human-like responses for various text-only instructions,\nhaving a profound impact on all walks of life.\n2.2. Multimodal Instruction-Following Tuning\nCompared to traditional visual-language models such as\nOscar (Li et al., 2020), Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022),\nOFA (Wang et al., 2022a), etc, the multimodal instruction-\nfollowing tuning approach explored extending the text-\nonly instruction tuning in LLMs to multi-modality. These\nMLLMs applying LLMs as the multimodal information\nprocessor achieve impressive zero-shot performances on un-seen tasks. Generally, as the traditional approach depicted\nin Figure 1, a frozen visual encoder (e.g., visual encoder\nof CLIP) is used to obtain the sequence representation of\nan image and a visual mapping network (VMN, a linear\nprojection layer or Q-former from BLIP-2) projects the im-\nage encoding into soft image embeddings into the language\nspace of LLMs. Then, we can utilize an efficient fine-tuning\ntechnical to allow LLMs to process multimodal information,\nthereby turning LLMs into MLLMs.\nFormally, a multimodal image-text instruction sample could\nbe expressed in the following triplet form, i.e., (I, T, R ),\nwhere I, T, R represent the input image, text description\n(about human demands or image-related premises), and\nground-truth response, respectively. During training, the\nconstructed MLLMs is forced to predict the next token of\nresponse via the autoregressive objective, which could be\npresented as:\nL(θ) =−NX\ni=1logP(Ri|I, T, R <i;θ), (1)\nwhere Nis the length of response and θrefers to the training\nparameters in the whole framework.\nIn conclusion, we find that these two approaches ignore\nintroducing visual knowledge to improve overall capabilities\nof LLMs for processing text-only tasks.\n3']","MKS2's visual information storage boosts LLMs' multimodal skills by injecting Modular Visual Memory (MVM) into internal blocks of LLMs, allowing them to memorize open-world visual information via language-centered learning strategies.

How do dataset language limits and manual template design affect factuality and safety in high-risk areas?,"['measure factuality and safety. This initial explo-\nration serves as a foundation to gain deeper insights\ninto the capabilities of current LLMs in tackling\nhigh-risk domain-specific NLP tasks and identify-\ning existing limitations that require attention and\nresolution.\nThe current setup has a series of shortcomings\nthat should be reduced in future work, namely: (1)\nthe collected datasets currently only focus on En-\nglish; (2) the instruction templates are designed\nmanually and might lead to variable outcomes; (3)\nother instruction-tuned models trained on general-\npurpose instructions might offer different capabili-\nties, depending on the specific context of domains\nand tasks; (4) other metrics should be explored and\nconsidered, such as robustness (Zhu et al., 2023)\nandexplainability (Zhao et al., 2023); and (5) users\nshould be aware that the metrics used are automatic\nand therefore themselves might also make mistakes\nand misrepresent model performance (i.e., the met-\nrics require separate benchmarking themselves).\nWe do not claim in any way that the presented\ntesting strategy would fulfill the EU AI Act require-\nments (this is due to points 1-3 as well as the fact\nthat the Act is not yet finalized).\nDespite the limitations of our contributions, the\nsignificance of this topic warrants attention. We\nhope that our work will serve as a catalyst to raise\nawareness and steer the community toward the de-\nvelopment of secure, reliable, and rigorously evalu-\nated LLMs, particularly in high-risk domains. Con-\ncretely, we should explore (1) how we can make\nLLMs more reliable, for example by improving\nfactuality via a retrieval step, and (2) ensure that\nquality metrics themselves are good enough to be\nused to accurately measure LLM abilities, particu-\nlarly for high-risk domains.\nEthics Statement\nOur work investigates the performance of LLMs\nfor high-risk domains with regard to factuality and\nsafety. We ran our empirical evaluation using ex-\nisting datasets, metrics, and LLMs for the domains\nof legal and medical. At this stage, we did not in-\nvolve any other stakeholders. We acknowledge that\nthis is an important next step, for example, to seek\nadvice from medical or legal experts, in order to\ninvestigate the performance of LLMs for particular\ndomains.

Palm: Scaling', 'ity, we seek to ensure that the responses of LLMs\nalign with accurate information, which is of ut-\nmost importance in high-risk applications. Two\nmetrics are considered and have been shown to\nalign with human judgments: QAFactEval (Fabbri\net al., 2022), which measures fine-grained over-\nlap of the generated text against the ground truth,\nand UniEval (Zhong et al., 2022), which computes\nover several dimensions, namely coherence, consis-\ntency, fluency, and relevance. (2) Safety is defined\nas the degree of insensibility and responsibility in\nthe generated content that is safe, unbiased, and\nreliable. High-risk domains often involve sensitive\ntopics, legal regulations, and ethical considerations,\nthus ensuring safety in the generated contents mit-\nigates the potential of unintended consequences,\nsuch as perpetuating harmful stereotypes or gener-\nating discriminatory content (Kaddour et al., 2023).\nEvaluating safety involves assessing the model’s\npropensity to avoid generating content that could be\noffensive, harmful, or inappropriate. We consider\nDetoxify (Hanu and Unitary team, 2020) and Safe-\ntyKit (Dinan et al., 2022), which measure a model’s\ntendencies to agree to offensive content or give the\nuser false impressions of its capabilities as well as\nother safety concerns. Although our primary focus\nis on ensuring factuality and safety, it is essential to\nunderscore the significance of other critical factors,\nsuch as robustness (Zhu et al., 2023), that are also\nvital for evaluating LLMs. While acknowledging\nthe broader spectrum of evaluation dimensions that\nwarrant attention in comprehensive assessments of\nLLMs, our emphasis on factuality andsafety is\nprioritized by the pressing and tangible concerns\nrelated to misinformation and potential harm in\nhigh-risk domains.

How do story quality eval methods differ in reproducibility and cost between humans and LLMs?,"['the score rated by the LLM. We call this process\nLLM evaluation , and this procedure is shown in the\nlower part of Figure 1. Different tasks use different\nsets of task instructions, and each task uses differ-\nent questions to evaluate the quality of the samples.\nThe instructions and questions used in LLM evalua-\ntion in our paper are not tailored for the LLMs; we\nfollow those instructions used to conduct human\nevaluation in prior works.\nTo compare the result of LLM evaluation and\nshow its effectiveness, we compare the result of\nLLM evaluation with human evaluation conducted\nby English teachers. To make a fair and meaningful\ncomparison, the instructions, samples, and ques-\ntions in human evaluation are formatted similarly\nto those in LLM evaluation. The main difference\nbetween LLM evaluation and human evaluation\nis that in human evaluation, the human evaluators\nanswer the question by choosing the answer from\na pre-deﬁned set of options (the 1-5 Likert scale\nscores), as shown in the upper right in Figure 1.\nIn LLM evaluation, we instead let the LLM freely\ngenerate sentences and extract the score from the\ngenerated sentences using some simple rules, de-\ntailed in Appendix D.2.1.\n3 Example Task 1: Open-Ended Story\nGeneration\nWe ﬁrst use open-ended story generation to demon-\nstrate the usefulness of LLM evaluation.\n3.1 Task Introduction\nOpen-ended story generation is a task to gener-\nate a short story based on a given prompt. We\nuse the WritingPrompts dataset (Fan et al., 2018),\nwhich is composed of pairs of short prompts and\nhuman-written stories collected from the subred-\nditWritingPrompts . In the WritingPrompts , the\nusers are given a short prompt, and they need to\nwrite a story based on the short prompt.1\nIn this experiment, we use LLM evaluation and\nhuman evaluation to rate the stories generated by\nhumans and the stories generated by a story gen-\neration model. We select open-ended story gen-\neration as an example because Karpinska et al.\n(2021) show that workers from Amazon Mechani-\ncal Turk (AMT) cannot distinguish GPT-2 (Radford\net al., 2019) generated and human-written stories,\n1The WritingPrompts subreddit explicitly forbids the\nusers to use AI for generating stories, so we consider the\nstories in the dataset to be human-written.while English teachers show a clear preference for\nhuman-written stories over GPT-2-generated sto-\nries. We want to see if LLM can rate human-written\nstories higher than GPT-2-generated ones.\nFollowing prior works (Mao et al., 2019; Guan\net al., 2020; Karpinska et al., 2021), the story gen-\neration model is GPT-2 medium model ﬁne-tuned\non the WritingPrompts training dataset. After the\nmodel is trained, we randomly select 200 prompts\nfrom the testing set of WritingPrompts and make\nthe ﬁne-tuned GPT-2 generate stories based on\nthose prompts using nucleus sampling (Holtzman\net al., 2020) with p= 0.9. For the human-written\nstories to be compared, we use the 200 stories\nwritten based on the same 200 prompts. We post-\nprocess the human-written and GPT-2-generated\nstories and then use them for LLM evaluation and\nhuman evaluation. Please ﬁnd the details on ﬁne-\ntuning and data processing in Appendix B.\n3.2 LLM Evaluation and Human Evaluation\nWe present the LLMs and the human evaluators\nwith a short description, and the story to be eval-\nuated, formatted as shown in Figure 1. Follow-\ning Karpinska et al. (2021), we evaluate the stories\non four different attributes. The four attributes and\ntheir corresponding questions are as follows:\n1.Grammaticality : How grammatically cor-\nrect is the text of the story fragment?\n2.Cohesiveness : How well do the sentences in\nthe story fragment ﬁt together ?\n3.Likability : How enjoyable do you ﬁnd the\nstory fragment?\n4.Relevance : Now read the PROMPT based on\nwhich the story fragment was written.\nPrompt :[PROMPT] .\nHow relevant is the story fragment to the\nprompt?\nWhere the [PROMPT] will be ﬁlled in with the\nprompt which the story is based on. Each attribute\nis evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale; the fol-\nlowing description is appended at the end of each\nquestion: "" (on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the low-\nest)"". We show the interface used in human evalua-\ntion and the input format for the LLM evaluation\nin Appendix C.2 and D.2.2.\nThe LLMs used for LLM evaluation include T0,\ntext-curie-001 ,text-davinci-003 , and Chat-\nGPT. text-curie-001 and text-davinci-003', 'learning ability, they are not always suitable to be\nused for LLM evaluation. Still, we ﬁnd that the\nbest InstructGPT and ChatGPT can rate the quality\nof texts like human experts on the two tasks we\nused as examples. Overall, the results in this paper\ndemonstrate that LLM evaluation has the potential\nto be used to evaluate NLP systems and algorithms.\nPros of LLM evaluation There are several ben-\neﬁts of LLM evaluation, compared to human evalu-\nation. First, LLM evaluation is more reproducible .\nHuman evaluation results are hard to reproduce as\nit is difﬁcult to hire the same group of evaluators,\nand it is hard to compare the results of similar ex-\nperiments even if they use the same instructions, re-\ncruitment platform, and qualiﬁcations for the eval-\nuators. On the contrary, LLM evaluation does not\nhave such a drawback. By specifying the model\nused for LLM evaluation, the random seed, and\nthe hyperparameters used to generate the answers\nfrom the LLM, the LLM evaluation result is more\nlikely to be reproduced. Note that in certain cases,\nthe LLM provider may regularly update the LLM,\nmaking the LLM evaluation unreproducible if the\nLLM is outdated and not accessible.\nSecond, the evaluation of each sample is inde-\npendent of each other in LLM evaluation . Con-\ntrarily, in human evaluation, the rating of the cur-\nrent example may more or less be affected by prior\nsamples. Humans tend to compare the current sam-\nple to the ones they have previously seen and this\naffects their ratings. As a piece of evidence, in the\ninterview after rating the 400 stories, the English\nteachers say it took them some time to calibrate\ntheir ratings (Appendix C.3.1). Thus, using LLM\nevaluation can simplify some experiment designs\nsince one does not need to worry whether the order\nof the sample being evaluated will change the result.\nStill, one may also argue that being able to calibrate\nthe rating of different samples is desired and this\nis why human evaluation might be preferred. Over-\nall, whether the rating of the evaluator (human or\nLLM) is being affected by a previously rated item\nis inherently a design choice of the experiment.\nThird, LLM evaluation is cheaper and faster\nthan human evaluation, making it easier and\nquicker for researchers to evaluate the quality of\nNLP systems. Hiring an English teacher to rate\n200 stories costs us US$140, while LLM evalua-\ntion using the best InstructGPT model costs less\nthan US$5. It took us over a week to collect human\nevaluation results starting from recruitment to col-lecting the evaluation results, but only a few hours\nto query InstructGPT and perform LLM evaluation.\nFinally, utilizing LLM evaluation, rather than\nhuman evaluation, can minimize the need for hu-\nman exposure to objectionable content , such as\nviolent, sexual, hateful, or biased material. Such\ncontent may cause discomfort for human evaluators\nwhile reading and rating these texts.5\nLimitations and Ethical Considerations of\nLLM evaluation Despite the promising results\nof LLM evaluation shown in this paper, there\nare some limitations of this method. First, LLM\nmay possess incorrect factual knowledge (Cao\net al., 2021), so it is not suitable to use them in\ntasks that involve factual knowledge. Next, LLMs\ntrained to behave in a certain way can be biased\ntoward certain responses. Precisely, an LLM that\nis trained to be safe and non-harmful can result\nin LLMs preferring to generate more positive and\nupbeat responses, which is observed throughout\nour interaction with ChatGPT. Additionally, even\nwith researchers’ efforts to make LLMs safer (Bai\net al., 2022a,b), LLMs can still generate harmful\nand biased responses (Ganguli et al., 2022; Perez\net al., 2022), which are violative of basic ethics,\nand LLM evaluation results will be highly doubt-\nful (Hendrycks et al., 2021). However, it is im-\nportant to note that these limitations and potential\nharms also apply to human evaluation: the bias of\nhuman evaluators can affect the human evaluation\nresult (Lentz and De Jong, 1997; Amidei et al.,\n2018).\nOur pioneering idea, LLM evaluation, has the\npotential to transform the NLP community.6We\nencourage future researchers to consider using it\nwhile being aware of its limitations. Our paper’s\ngoal is not to replace human evaluation but to\npresent an alternative option. Both human and\nLLM evaluation have their own advantages and dis-\nadvantages, and they can be used in conjunction.\nWe recommend using LLM evaluation as a cheap\nand fast quality judgment when developing a new\nNLP system, while human evaluation is best used\nto collect feedback from humans prior to deploying\n5It should be noted that the LLM may decline to assess cer-\ntain inputs that violate the content policy of the LLM provider.\n6We say that we are the ﬁrst to propose this idea since when\nwe submitted this paper to ACL 2023 on January 13, 2023,\nwe do not ﬁnd any other paper that explores this idea. During\nthe reviewing process, we found some works on arXiv (Wang\net al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Gilardi et al., 2023) that\nexplore a similar idea using different tasks.']","LLM evaluation is more reproducible and cheaper compared to human evaluation.

The initial three rows in\nTable II, i.e. no function ,wrong function name , and wrong\ncount of arguments , align with the well-formedness check of\nthe Turbulence test oracle (Figure 2). Recall that each question\ninstance asks the LLM to write a Python function bearing the\nspecified name andcount of arguments (Figure 3).\nNo function. This is where the LLM does not even generate\na Python function, rendering the response unusable. We ob-\nserved this for Command (t=D) and GPT-3.5 (t=D) for\ncertain question instances. When GPT-3.5 failed to generate\na function, its entire response was simply “ python, ”. In\ncontrast, when Command (t=D) failed to generate a function\nit exhibited a variety of generated strings or code snippets,\nnone of which conformed to the structure of Python functions\n(e.g., an import, followed by a print statement, and nothing\nmore).\nWrong function name. This is where the LLM generates a\nfunction but with a different name from that requested in the\nprompt. Such responses count as failures because each Turbu-\nlence test oracle requires an appropriately named function, and\nthere is no systematic, reliable way to fix up function names\n(especially since some responses contain multiple functions).\nAtt=D, all LLMs exhibit this problem for some instances;\ne.g. GPT-3.5 (t=D) was prompted to generate a function\nnamed lists with product equal n, but produced a function\ncalled “circular product” instead.\nWrong number of arguments. Here, the LLM yields an\nappropriately named function but one that takes the wrong\nnumber of arguments and is thus not compatible with the test\noracle.Except GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 , all LLMs suffer from this\nproblem, and Table II shows that the problem worsens for\nthese models at increased temperature. One example occurred\nwhen Command ( t=D) was asked to write a function\ncalled find original setthat took exactly 7 distinct arguments\nbut the LLM produced a function with the following sig-\nnature: def find_original_set(A, B, C, D, E, F) . In\ncontrast, GPT-3.5 andGPT-4 never produced functions with\nincorrect counts of argument.\nSyntax errors. This is where the LLM output cannot be\nparsed as it does not conform to the grammar of Python.\nThe primary source of such errors stemmed from unmatched\nparentheses, the closing bracket ]not aligned with the opening\nparenthesis (, incorrect indentation, using comments in the\ncode without indicating them with ‘#’ or a pair of triple ticks,\nthe use of else if instead of elif , absence of except\norfinally blocks after employing a try block, invalid\nvariable naming (e.g. 6th_number was used as a variable),\nand invalid assignment targets (e.g. len(binary) -= 1 ,\nand56,96 = sorted(range(len(nums))) ). The prob-\nlem of syntax errors is worse at higher temperature.\nStatic type errors. This is where the integrated Pylint lin-\nter [34] identified a static type error in a generated code.\nThe observed errors include but are not limited to: un-\ndefined variables (e.g. using math.gcd without importing\nthemath library), Python keywords as variable names (e.g.\nsum = sum(multiples) ), using unexpected keyword argu-\nments in function calls (e.g. using unexpected keyword argu-\nment axis innumpy.arrange ), and calling non-callables\n(e.g.if not s.size(): break where swas a numpy\narray).\nIn all LLMs, except for GPT-4 , raising the temperature from\n0 to its default setting resulted in a rise in both the quantity\nand variety of errors in the generated responses.\nResource exhaustion error. This category relates to cases\nwhere the generated code exceeded time or memory re-\nsources when executed. Numerous cases were observed across\n8', 'CodeLlama-7 CodeLlama-13 Command GPT-3.5 GPT-4\nCategories t= 0 t=D t= 0 t=D t= 0 t=D t= 0 t=D t= 0 t=D\nno function 0 0 0 0 0 136 0 40 0 0\nwrong function name 0 7 0 42 1 5 0 21 0 71\nwrong count of arguments 1120 1213 245 806 0 6 0 0 0 0\nsyntax error 1470 3517 140 250 341 589 0 11 0 20\nstatic type error 1071 2803 3085 2787 2303 1764 240 272 10 15\nresource exhaustion 190 189 5 37 11 110 677 365 278 274\nruntime error 2294 2429 1422 2055 3243 4020 586 893 168 311\nassertion error 13694 10905 13227 13169 20074 19305 8146 7995 2792 3266\nfuzzing failure 1476 1494 2056 2080 2357 2184 1850 2026 1314 1398\npassed 8685 7443 9820 8774 1670 1881 18501 18377 25438 24645\ntotal 30000 30000 30000 30000 30000 30000 30000 30000 30000 30000\nTABLE II: Counts of responses based on the test failure categories and passing tests\nall LLMs wherein their responses had this type of error,\neven though the given question instance could be addressed\nin a more cost-efficient manner. One example belongs to\nis when GPT-4 (t=D) was prompted to write a func-\ntion that took a set of elements and returned the num-\nber of all its subsets of size 54. The LLM response re-\nturned len(list(combinations(elements, 54))) .\nThe built-in function itertools.combinations imple-\nments the binomial coefficient. If the function generated by\nthe LLM receives a set larger than 63, its execution will be\nhighly expensive, if possible at all. To solve the question, one\ncan easily use math.comb(len(elements), 54) which\nfunctions effectively with sets of any substantial size.\nRuntime errors. This category aligns with cases where the ex-\necution of the generated code resulted in a Python error such as\nIndexError, AttributeError, etc. This category aligns with cases\nwhere the execution of the generated code resulted in a Python\nerror. The errors observed were IndexError, AttributeError,\nValueError, UnboundLocalError, ZeroDivisionError, KeyError,\nOverflowError, AttributeError, ZeroDivisionError, NameError,\nand TypeError ( for i in range(2, x+1) where xwas\na tuple and concatenation of an ‘int’ and a ‘tuple’ is invalid).\nAssertion errors and fuzzing failure. Assertion errors and\nfuzzing failure correspond to cases where the generated code\nwas executed successfully but it was functionally wrong. This\nimplies that these bugs were functional and did not correspond\nto any error category outlined in the first seven rows of\nTable II. We provide an overview of the primary causes behind\nfunctional failures within incorrect responses by grouping\nthese responses into five distinct groups as follows. The first\ngroup includes the responses that featured incorrect ranges.\nIn cases where question instances specified an index range or\na number range, the main bug was associated with the code\nresponse either excluding the specified range or, if included,\nhaving inaccuracies in either the lower-bound, upper-bound, or\nboth. Figure 7 provides 5 code snippets. The code displayed\nin Figure 7a was consistently generated by CodeLlama-13\n(t=0) across all 5 rounds. The code does not include the index\nrange specified in the corresponding question instance. Withthe same question instance, CodeLlama-13 (t=D) generated 4\nwrong answers and one correct answer. Within the 5 rounds, in\nthe first round, it generated the code displayed in Figure 7b (we\nwill explain the problem with this code within the fourth group\nof functional errors); in the second, third and fourth rounds,\nthe LLM consistently generated the code shown in Figure 7c\nwhere the upper bound of the list slicing should be 1instead\nof1 + 1 ; and in the last round it produced a correct answer\nthat is presented in Figure 7d. Comparing the performance\nof the LLM under two temperature configurations, we notice\nthat at the default temperature, the LLM exhibited greater\nstochasticity, providing a wider range of random responses,\none of which happened to be correct. Yet, the inclination of\nthe LLM to produce the answer depicted in Figure 7c was\nmore pronounced, occurring 3 out of 5 times at t=Dand 5\nout of 5 times at t=0.\nThe second group consists of the responses that exhibited\nan incorrect logical order of tasks, that is, the LLMs attempted\nto address the given question instances, but their solutions\nexhibited an incorrect logical sequence of tasks. One example\noccurred when CodeLlama-7 (t=D) was tasked with return-\ning the second largest number from index 31 to index 72 (both\ninclusive) in a given list of distinct numbers. The generated\ncode initially sorted the entire list, sliced it from index 31 to\n73, and finally returned the number at index 1 of the sliced\nlist. The issue with this solution lies in the fact that the code\nshould have first sliced the given list based on the specified\nindex range, then sorted it, and ultimately returned the number\nat index 1.\nThe third group belongs to the responses that indicated\na lack of understanding by the LLM regarding the question\ninstance. As an example, Command (t= 0) was asked to\ndetermine whether the integer at index 85 of a given list\nof positive integers was a perfect number. The body of the\ngenerated code included only one line which was return\nnums [85] == 64820 where nums served as a placeholder\nfor the given list of integers.\nThe fourth group includes the responses wherein a re-\ndundant portion of code rendered the entire functional-\n9']","The context provides detailed information on how different LLMs (CodeLlama-7, CodeLlama-13, Command, GPT-3.5, GPT-4) exhibit various failure types when generating Python functions.

"How does LAPE identify language-specific neurons, and what are its limits in multilingual models?","['Limitations\nIn this study, we employ language activation prob-\nability entropy as a metric to identify language-\nspecific neurons.

Association for Computational\nLinguistics.', '2.2 Language Activation Probability Entropy\nIn existing research, neurons within the FFN mod-\nules are found to be capable of storing factual\nknowledge (Dai et al., 2022), encoding positional\ninformation (V oita et al., 2023), responding to par-\nticular syntactic triggers (Gurnee et al., 2024), etc.\nInspired by these findings, we posit that there exist\nspecific neurons in LLMs for multilingual process-\ning. Next, we introduce a new detection method\nbased on language activation probability entropy\n(LAPE ) to identify language-specific neurons.\nOur research primarily focuses on pre-trained\nbase models ( e.g., LLaMA-2 and BLOOM), rather\nthan fine-tuned models that have undergone instruc-\ntion tuning or RLHF ( e.g., LLaMA-2-Chat and\nBLOOMZ), which helps reduce other influencing\nfactors. Specially, we feed existing LLMs with mul-\ntilingual texts, each written in a single language.\nFor the j-th neuron in the i-th layer, we then com-\npute the activation probability when processing\ntexts in language k:\npk\ni,j=E\x10\nI(act_fn (ˆhiWi\n1)j>0)|language k\x11\n,\n(4)\nwhere Iis the indicator function. The activation\nprobability is empirically estimated by the likeli-\nhood that the neuron’s activation value exceeds\nzero. Subsequently, we can obtain the distribu-\ntionpi,j= (p1\ni,j, . . . , pk\ni,j, . . . , pl\ni,j)for each neu-\nron, indicating its probability of activation for each\nlanguage. To convert pi,jinto a valid probability\ndistribution, we apply L1 normalization, yielding\np′\ni,j. The entropy of this distribution, which we\nrefer to as language activation probability entropy ,\nis computed to quantify the neuron’s language acti-\nvation reaction:\nLAPE i,j=−lX\nk=1p′k\ni,jlog(p′k\ni,j). (5)\nWe designate neurons with low LAPE scores as\n“language-specific neurons ”, as they demonstrate\na predilection for activation in response to one or\ntwo languages, while showing reduced activation\nprobabilities for others.\nIn implementation, we collect multilingual cor-\npora sourced from Wikipedia, a widely recognized\nand high-quality resource for diverse languages,\nand sample documents to create a dataset compris-\ning 100 million tokens for each language. Subse-\nquently, we input these tokens into a target LLM\nand follow Equations 4 and 5 to compute the LAPEscore for individual neurons. Finally, we select neu-\nrons that fall within the lowest percentile of LAPE\nscores, specifically targeting the bottom 1%. To\nrefine our selection, we further impose a predefined\nthreshold to exclude neurons exhibiting negligible\nactivation probability: a neuron is deemed specific\nto language kif its corresponding activation proba-\nbility pk\ni,jsurpasses the threshold.\n3 Experiments\nIn this section, we present empirical evaluation to\nsubstantiate the efficacy of our proposed LAPE\nmethod and elucidate the impact of language-\nspecific neurons on multilingual capacities.\n3.1 Experimental Setup\nModels. We conduct the study based on two pub-\nlic LLMs: LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), pri-\nmarily pre-trained on English texts and known for\nits excellence as a language foundational model,\nand BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), known for its\nmultilingual proficiency with a more balanced\nlanguage distribution. We investigate multiple\nversions of LLaMA-2, specifically the 7B, 13B,\nand 70B models, containing approximately 352K,\n553K, and 2.29M neurons, respectively. For\nBLOOM, we select the 7.1B version, consisting of\nroughly 492K neurons. The languages selected in-\nclude English ( en), Simplified Chinese ( zh), French\n(fr), Spanish ( es), Vietnamese ( vi), Indonesian ( id),\nand Japanese ( ja). We exclude ja for BLOOM since\nit has not been pre-trained on Japanese copora.\nDataset. Our analysis of language-specific neu-\nrons is conducted across two distinct dimensions:\n•Language modeling : We assess the multilin-\ngual language modeling capability using perplexity\n(PPL) scores on Wikipedia corpora. Our dataset\ncomprises one million tokens per language, all\nsourced after September 2022 to ensure the content\nhas not been included in the training sets of either\nLLaMA-2 or BLOOM.\n•Open-ended generation : To evaluate model’s\nmultilingual generation capabilities in real-world\nscenarios, we translate a set of questions from the\nVicuna dataset (Chiang et al., 2023) into the target\nlanguages. These questions span a broad spec-\ntrum of topics, excluding mathematics and coding\nqueries to maintain a focus on language processing\nproficiency, avoiding confounding variables. We\nutilize greedy search with repetition penalty of 1.1']","LAPE identifies language-specific neurons by computing the activation probability of neurons when processing texts in different languages. The activation probability is estimated by the likelihood that a neuron's activation value exceeds zero. The entropy of this distribution, referred to as language activation probability entropy (LAPE), quantifies the neuron's language activation reaction. Neurons with low LAPE scores are designated as language-specific neurons, as they show a predilection for activation in response to one or two languages while showing reduced activation probabilities for others.

How do visual-language LLMs' relational skills affect concept and graph extraction?,"['18 \n \uf0b7 Relational understanding: The ability to understand the relationships between entities in an image. \n\uf0b7 Compositional understanding: The ability to understand how entities in an image can be combined to form new \nconcepts. \n\uf0b7 Contextual understanding: The ability to understand how the context of an image can affect the interpretation of its \ncontent. \nIt finds that visual-language LLMs are able to achieve good performance on tasks that require relational understanding , \nsuch as image question answering. However, they are less successful on tasks that require compositional and contextual \nunderstanding , such as visual question generation. This suggests that visual-language LLMs may not have a deep \nunderstanding of the content they are processing. \nConcept Extraction from Text and Image with Visual-Language LLMs  \nConcept extraction  is the process of identifying and extracting concepts from text or image. This is a challenging task, as \nconcepts can be represented in a variety of ways, both in text and in image. Concept extraction from text  has been discussed \nin Section 4 Concept Extraction from Text with LLMs. \nVisual-language LLMs can be used for concept extraction from image  in a number of ways. One way is to use the LLM \nto generate a  natural language description  of an image. This description can then be analyzed to identify the concepts that \nare present in the image. Another way is to use the LLM to answer questions  about an image. The questions that are asked \ncan be designed to elicit information about specific concepts. For example, a question like ""What is the object in the \nforeground?"" can be used to extract the concept of ""object"" from the image. Finally, both ways can be combined by using the \nLLM to generate a natural language description of an image, and then using the LLM to answer questions about the image. \nThe combination of the natural language description and the answers to the questions can then be used to identify the \nconcepts that are present in the image. \nHere are some examples of how concept extraction from image can be used in real-world applications : \n\uf0b7 Image search: Concept extraction can be used to improve the accuracy of image search. By identifying the concepts \nthat are present in an image, visual-language LLMs can help to match the image to relevant search results. ', ""19 \n \uf0b7 Virtual assistants: Concept extraction can be used to improve the capabilities of virtual assistants. By understanding \nthe concepts that are present in a user's query with image, virtual assistants can provide more relevant and \ninformative responses. \nConcept Graph Extraction from Text and Image with Visual-Language LLMs  \nConcept graph extraction  is the task of extracting a graph of concepts from text or image. Concept graph extraction from \ntext has been discussed in Section 5 Concept Graph Extraction from Text with LLMs. \nThere are a number of different approaches to concept graph extraction from image , including: \n\uf0b7 Text-based approaches: These approaches use natural language processing techniques to extract concepts from the \ntext associated with an image . \n\uf0b7 Image-based approaches: These approaches use computer vision techniques to extract concepts from the image \nitself. \n\uf0b7 Hybrid approaches: These approaches combine text-based and image-based approaches to extract concepts from \nboth the image and the associated text. \nConcept graph extraction from image can be used for a variety of tasks, such as: \n\uf0b7 Image understanding: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of an image, which can then \nbe used to understand the meaning of the image. \n\uf0b7 Visual question answering: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of a question involving \nimage, which can then be used to answer the question. \n\uf0b7 Visual dialogue: Concept graphs can be used to represent the conceptual structure of a dialogue involving image, \nwhich can then be used to generate more natural and engaging dialogue. \nVisual-Language LLMs for Concept Learning  \nVisual-language LLMs can be used for concept learning  in a number of ways, including: ""]","Visual-language LLMs are able to achieve good performance on tasks that require relational understanding, such as image question answering.

"How do T5's pre-training tasks/datasets for code review compare to Codeditor's for cross-lingual editing, and what are the performance implications?","['IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 42\nactivities necessitate developers to review, understand, and\nexecute code to assess logic, functionality, latency, style, and\nother factors. The improvements in LLM combined with\nCode Review mainly focus on leveraging LLMs (primarily\nthe T5 model) to automate the code review process. They\npredominantly concentrate on enhancing code quality and\nreview efficiency through data collection and preparation,\npre-training task design, and evaluation for performance\nimprovement.\nExploration of T5 in Code Review. In 2022, Li et al. [160]\nintroduce AUGER, which uses a pre-trained T5 model to\nautomatically generate code review comments. Firstly, it col-\nlected 79,344 Java code reviews from GitHub and then built\na framework utilizing the T5 model for automatic integra-\ntion and generation of review comments. This collaborative\napproach effectively captures the relationship between code\nand review language, outperforming baseline models such\nas LSTM, COPYNET, and CodeBERT, and allows for real-\ntime feedback. The model is capable of further training and\ncovers unfamiliar programs more freely than individuals.\nAdditionally, it adopts several criteria from previous stud-\nies to assess the generated comments, providing a certain\ndegree of usefulness akin to human review comments. In\nfuture work, the paper aims to explore implementation\nwithout language differences and extend its widespread\napplication for collaborative review of new systems with\nprofessionals.\nIn parallel to AUGER [160], Tufano et al. [161] propose\nto apply a pre-trained T5 model for code review tasks.\nThey create a pre-training Java dataset including both source\ncode and technical English by collecting from two datasets\n(i.e.,, the official Stack Overflow dump and CodeSearchNet)\nand filtering out unqualified instances. To perform the pre-\ntraining, they randomly mask in each instance 15% of its\ntokens. They adopt T5-small and pre-train it with the same\nconfiguration by Raffel et al. [6]. Then, they create the fine-\ntuning dataset by mining Java open-source projects from\nGitHub and from the six Gerrit installations which contain\ncode review data. They extract triplets ¡ ms,cnl,mr¿ from\nboth datasets: a method submitted for the review, a review’s\ncomment suggesting code changes and the revised version\nof the code. They use the fine-tuning dataset for three\ndownstream tasks. In the first task (code-to-code), the model\ntakes msas input and is expected to generate mr. In the\nsecond task (code&comment-to-code), the model takes both\nmsandcnlas input and is expected to generate mr. In\nthe third task (code-to-comment), the model takes msas\ninput and is expected to generate cnl. After evaluating the\napproach on the fine-tuning dataset, they find that their\napproach outperforms the baseline model [182] and the non-\npre-trained T5 model.\nDomain LLM for Code Review. Liet al. [159] propose\nCodeReviewer, which is based on the Transformer archi-\ntecture, adopts the same structure as the T5 model, and\ninitializes it with parameters from CodeT5. CodeReviewer\nfocuses on how to use pre-training techniques to automate\nthe code review process, ensuring code quality. The authors\nstart by collecting a large dataset from open-source projects\non GitHub, covering nine programming languages, consist-\ning of code changes and code reviews. They then use this\ndataset for pre-training and subsequently for three impor-tant tasks: code change quality estimation, review comment\ngeneration, and code refinement. To enhance the model’s\nunderstanding, Li et al. design four pre-training tasks, in-\ncluding Diff Tag Prediction (DTP) task, denoising code diff\n(DCD), denoising review comment (DRC), and review com-\nment generation. These tasks aim to help the model better\nunderstand code differences and generate relevant review\ncomments. The authors categorize these tasks into classifica-\ntion and generation tasks, utilizing the pre-trained encoder\nfor the former and the entire encoder-decoder model for the\nlatter. Finally, they evaluate CodeReviewer’s performance\non both the pre-training dataset and the processed dataset,\nwith results indicating that CodeReviewer outperforms two\npreviously established pre-trained models: T5 and CodeT5-\nbase.\nExploration of ChatGPT in Code Review. Guo et\nal.[162] explore the potential of ChatGPT in automated\ncode refinement tasks through a pioneering empirical study,\nwith a specific focus on code refinement based on code\nreviews. The authors assess the impact of different Chat-\nGPT configurations on its performance across standard\ncode review benchmarks and a newly collected dataset.\nIn this empirical study, the researchers optimize param-\neter settings for ChatGPT and find that it performs ex-\nceptionally well on both the CodeReview dataset and the\nnewly constructed CodeReview-New dataset, demonstrat-\ning superior generalization capabilities. A detailed anal-\nysis reveals that ChatGPT exhibits stable performance\ncompared to CodeReviewer, particularly excelling on the\nhigh-quality CodeReview-New dataset. However, for cases\nwhere CodeReviewer performs less optimally, the re-\nsearchers identify several key root causes, including accu-\nracy in understanding review content, excessive deletions,\nadditional modifications, and difficulty in grasping foun-\ndational truths in code blocks. The study also uncovers\nchallenges faced by ChatGPT in tasks such as document\nand functionality refinement, primarily stemming from in-\nadequate domain knowledge, unclear location information,\nand ambiguities in review comments regarding changes.\nThe authors propose potential strategies for improvement,\nemphasizing the enhancement of review quality and the\nutilization of more advanced LLMs like GPT-4. Overall, this\nresearch provides insights into the potential of ChatGPT in\ncode refinement tasks and lays the foundation for future\nstudies integrating ChatGPT more deeply.\n4.4.6 Bug Report Detection\nDuplicate Bug Report Detection (DBRD) plays a crucial role\nin software development. Sometimes, when users report\nsoftware defects in issue tracking systems such as Bugzilla,\nJira, or GitHub, duplicate bug reports emerge. The task of\nDBRD is to automatically identify and label these duplicate\nbug reports, enabling developers to avoid redundantly deal-\ning with the same issues. Recognizing duplicate bug reports\nsaves time and effort for developers, thereby enhancing the\nefficiency of software development.\nIn DBRD, algorithms and methods compare and analyze\nthe similarity between different bug reports to determine if\nthey describe the same defect or problem. These methods\ntypically involve comparing textual content, using natu-\nral language processing and machine learning techniques', 'IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 23\ntialized with GraphCodeBERT and fine-tuned with CCT,\ndemonstrated the efficacy of the CCT technique in gen-\nerating useful representations for code search. For code\nsearch, CCT uses the CodeSearchNet AdvTest dataset. The\nCCT-LM model, initialized with CCT, achieves an average\nMean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 47.18% in the AdvTest code\nsearch benchmark.\nCombined with the effectiveness of transfer learning,\nSalza et al. [76] try to explore how to apply the transformer\narchitecture and transfer learning to code search. Thus,\nthey propose a pre-trained BERT-based approach with fine-\ntuning. This approach contains two pre-trained BERT-based\nencoders, one for queries and one for code. For the query\nencoder, they use the Devlin et al. [5] pre-trained English\nmodel. For the code encoder, they pre-train it on the Code-\nSearchNet dataset. They apply the BERT model like pre-\ntraining on natural language and the next line prediction\nfor pre-training on source code. They then mine and filter\nquestion-answer pairs from StackOverflow as the dataset\nfor fine-tuning. Finally, they combine the two pre-trained\nencoders as the multimodal embedding model and fine-\ntune it. They apply 10-fold cross-validation and evaluate\ntheir approach on their collected dataset. Results show\nthat the pre-trained model outperforms the non-pre-trained\nmodel. Besides, their approach outperforms an information\nretrieval model based on Lucene. They also discover that\nthe combination of an information retrieval-based approach\nfollowed by a Transformer achieves the best results.\n4.2.3 Code Translation\nCode translation has been extensively studied for natural\nlanguages, but has received little attention in the context of\nprogramming languages. code translation for programming\nlanguages refers to the use of data from a source language to\nimprove the performance of a model on a target language.\ntransfer learning with LLMs improved the performance of\nvarious software engineering tasks, including code summa-\nrization, code search, clone detection, code refinement and\nso on.\nIn 2023, Zhang et al. [77] design Codeditor, an LLM\nproposed for the task of cross-lingual code editing, incor-\nporating a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework.\nCodeditor’s parameters are initialized using CoditT5. Sub-\nsequently, to adapt to multi-language collaborative editing\ntasks, Codeditor is fine-tuned, focusing on the model’s\ninput context and output format. For training and evalu-\nation, Zhang et al. extract the first dataset containing paired\ncode changes from 8 open-source Java projects and their\ncorresponding C# projects’ commit histories on GitHub.\nThis dataset encompasses parallel code modifications in\ntwo programming languages. Evaluation occurs in two\ndirections: updating C# methods based on Java modifi-\ncations (source language: Java, target language: C#), and\nupdating Java methods based on C# modifications (source\nlanguage: C#, target language: Java). The experimental re-\nsults demonstrate that Codeditor outperforms all existing\nmodels across all selected automatic metrics. This includes\nfine-tuned LLMs like Codex under few-shot settings and\nChatGPT under zero-shot settings. In the task of updating\nC# code based on Java modifications, Codeditor achieves\na CodeBLEU score of 96 (out of 100), exceeding by over25% the performance of LLMs fine-tuned specifically for\nthis task. Furthermore, Codeditor and generative models\ncomplement each other: Codeditor excels in updating longer\ncode snippets, while generative models perform better with\nshorter ones. By combining these two models, based on the\ninput code’s size, Codeditor’s accuracy in exact matching is\nfurther enhanced by 6%.\nAt the same time, Baltaji et al. [78] extensively explore\ncode translation learning using transformer-based LLMs\nacross 41 programming languages in four tasks (classifica-\ntion and generation tasks). They conduct experiments using\nsix common source languages (Javascript, C, Kotlin, Java,\nC++, and Python) to identify the best source language.\nBaltaji et al. calculate the average scores for each language\nin every task across all target languages and rank these\nlanguages based on the average scores. Their experimental\nframework is based on CodeT5-base (220M) and open-\nsource datasets CodeNet and XCodeEval, incorporating 58\nfine-tuned models. The experimental results indicate that\ncross-lingual learning outperforms LLM zero-shot learning\nsignificantly. In this context, C++ and Python are compara-\ntively less ideal as either source or target languages, while\nKotlin exhibits the best transfer results, serving as a strong\nsource language for multiple target languages and tasks.\n4.2.4 Code Comment Completion\nCode comment completion refers to the process by which\na computer program or model automatically writes code\ncomments for programmers. In this process, based on the\ncode that has already been written, the program or model\nautomatically generates corresponding comments to explain\nthe function and purpose of the code. It aims to provide\nreal-time suggestions and assistance to programmers while\nwriting code comments, similar to the concept of code\nauto-completion. This process does not create comments\nfrom scratch but rather assists programmers in completing\ncomments more quickly based on the partial comments\nor code snippets they input. This autocomplete capability\nhelps reduce repetitive work during code writing, improves\nthe quality of code documentation, and offers better code\nreadability.\nIn 2021, Mastropaolo et al. [79]address the issue of\ncode comments using T5 and n-gram models. The study\ncompares a simple n-gram model and the T5 model in\nsupporting code comment completion. The findings indicate\nthat the T5 model performs better, although the n-gram\nmodel remains competitive. The research experiments with\na dataset containing a large number of Java methods and\ntheir associated comments. Results show that, firstly, the\nT5 model outperforms the n-gram model in all the tested\ncode comment completion scenarios. Secondly, despite the\nT5 model’s higher performance, it requires developers to\nhave already written a portion of the comment (similar to\nthe n-gram model) and to provide the relevant code context\nassociated with the comment. Lastly, the simplicity of the\nn-gram model and its wider applicability suggest potential\ncomplementarity between the two models in implementing\na code comment completion tool.']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '42', 'file_name': '2312.15223v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2312.15223v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1859979, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '23', 'file_name': '2312.15223v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2312.15223v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1859979, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
"What foundational tasks do LLMs perform in social networks, and how are these models fine-tuned to manage such tasks effectively?
output: What tasks do LLMs handle in social networks, and how are they fine-tuned?","['LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR SOCIAL NETWORKS :\nAPPLICATIONS , CHALLENGES ,AND SOLUTIONS\nJingying Zeng, Richard Huang, Waleed Malik, Langxuan Yin, Bojan Babic,\nDanny Shacham ,Xiao Yan ,Jaewon Yang ,Qi He\nNextdoor, USA\nABSTRACT\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the way people generate, explore, and engage with\ncontent. We study how we can develop LLM applications for online social networks. Despite LLMs’\nsuccesses in other domains, it is challenging to develop LLM-based products for social networks for\nnumerous reasons, and it has been relatively under-reported in the research community.\nWe categorize LLM applications for social networks into three categories. First is knowledge tasks\nwhere users want to find new knowledge and information, such as search and question-answering.\nSecond is entertainment tasks where users want to consume interesting content, such as getting\nentertaining notification content. Third is foundational tasks that need to be done to moderate and\noperate the social networks, such as content annotation and LLM monitoring. For each task, we\nshare the challenges we found, solutions we developed and lessons we learned. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first comprehensive paper about developing LLM applications for social\nnetworks.\nKeywords Generative AI ·Large Language Models ·Social Networks ·Machine Learning ·Reinforcement Learning ·\nRejection Sampling ·Natural Language GenerationarXiv:2401.02575v1  [cs.SI]  4 Jan 2024', '1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models(LLMs), such as GPT-3 [ Brown et al., 2020 ] and LLAMA [ Touvron et al., 2023 ], are AI\nmodels that can perform tasks by reading instructions. These models are pre-trained on large amounts of text corpora\nand then fine-tuned to perform tasks by following the instructions [ Ouyang et al., 2022 ]. LLMs have shown impressive\nperformance across different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, and shown a great potential to adapt to unseen\ntasks by in-context few-shot learning [ Brown et al., 2020 ,Xie et al., 2021 ]. If we want to customize LLMs for a\nspecific task, we can fine-tune LLMs with labeled data in the same way we train other AI models. LLMs bring a lot of\nopportunities for new AI applications due to its versatility.\nIn this paper, we aim to develop LLM applications for online social networks. Online social networks are the websites\nwhere people can connect and interact to each other for different purposes. People use Facebook and Instagram to\ninteract with their friends, LinkedIn to connect with their colleagues, and Nextdoor to learn what is going on in their\nneighborhoods. Social network sites have been developed (and incentivized) to maximize the amount of human-to-\nhuman interactions rather than human-to-computer interactions such as human-to-LLMs. It is fascinating to imagine\nhow LLMs can interact with users to help them interact with other users.\nWe note that different social network users have different reasons for using social networks, and thus decide to define a\nfew use case types for LLMs and tackle each type separately. Although the primary reason may be social interactions\nwith other users, the goal of interactions can be different. Sometimes users want to get information or new knowledge.\nFor example, users would post questions like “is this restaurant good?”. Or, users want to have fun by browsing\ninteresting content, like watching short video clips about cats and dogs. Lastly, there are foundational tasks that need to\nbe done regardless of applications, such as monitoring the health of LLMs, flagging malicious content on the site and so\non. In summary, we categorize the LLM applications for social networks as follows:\n•Knowledge tasks : Tasks where users want to get new knowledge or new information, such as Search among\nsocial posts, Asking questions to other social network users;\n•Engagement tasks : Tasks where we use LLMs to increase user engagement, e.g. creating interesting content\nfor notifications;\n•Foundation tasks : This includes tasks that bring impacts across many applications horizontally. For example,\nhow to build to manage the API usage and LLM health, and how to build knowledge graph with LLMs belong\nto this type.\nDeveloping LLM applications for social networks is a challenging job for many reasons. First, existing LLMs are not\ntrained for the tasks we mentioned above. For the knowledge tasks, social network users want to know about knowledge\nspecific to the user’s social context, such as “which park around my home has a nice tennis court”, and the training\ncorpora for LLMs do not contain this kind of local, long-tail knowledge. For the engagement tasks, it is even trickier to\ntrain LLMs because whether the content is engaging to users is highly subjective and specific to each social network.\nFor example, content popular among Instagram is very different from content popular among Twitter (or X) users.\nSecond challenge is that social networks are evolving over time while LLMs are static. For knowledge tasks, the\nknowledge and information keeps changing in the social networks, but LLMs’ knowledge does not get updated after\ntraining. For engagement tasks, users’ tastes changes dynamically over time.\nThird challenge is evaluation: to evaluate LLMs’ outputs and remove hallucinations (mentioning something that is\nincorrect). LLMs’ outputs are free form text which is time consuming to evaluate for human annotators.\nIn this paper, we discuss how to tackle the above challenges in a systematic way. These solutions come from 1-year\nexperience in developing several LLM applications for Nextdoor, a hyper-local social network for neighborhoods.\nWe found that different task types pose different challenges and need different solutions. Therefore, we will disucss\nchallenges and solutions for each type in the following sections. We believe that, although we present challenges and\nsolutions in the context of Nextdoor, these lessons are applicable to other social network settings.\nHere is a summary of solutions we discuss in the paper. For knowledge tasks, we employ Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) to retrieve the posts and comments from the social network that are relevant to a given task or\nquestion. RAG addresses the first and second challenges by providing LLMs with up-to-date knowledge from the social\nnetworks. Even with RAG, we found that the underlying LLMs make mistakes by referencing wrong content. To\naddress this, we fine-tune LLMs by teaching which types of answers should be preferred. We employed a fine-tuning\nmethod that is much simpler than Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback [ Ouyang et al., 2022 ]. For the\nevaluation challenge, we adopted a LLM-based approach to evaluate the quality of LLM outputs holistically.\nFor the engagement tasks, we developed a reward model that predicts if the users would interact with the content made\nby LLMs. We trained a reward model with our own user engagement data because each social network’s users have\n4']","Foundational tasks that LLMs perform in social networks include content annotation and LLM monitoring.

How does expert consultation refine the Mini-CEX using a 5-point Likert scale for reliability and validity?,"['•The opinions are summarized, collated and analyzed.

"How well do recent benchmarks assess LLMs' problem-solving generalization, and which models are tested?","['Computational Linguistics\n2.2.3 Induction Reasoning Competency\nIn contrast to deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning ai ms to derive conclusions from speciﬁc obser-\nvations to general principles ( Yang et al., 2022 ;Olsson et al., 2022 ). In recent years, a new paradigm\nof Induction Reasoning has been proposed by ( Cheng et al., 2023 ), which requires models to generate\ngeneral-purpose program code to solve a class of problems ba sed on given contextual questions and a\nspeciﬁc question. For example, Cheng et al. (2023 ),Jiang et al. (2023 ) and Sur´ ıs et al. (2023 ) induced\ngeneral principle-based solutions by generalizing each qu estion into a universal executable language.\nTherefore, for competency evaluation, while DEER ( Yang et al., 2022 ) and Mathematical Induction\n(BIGBench Split ( Srivastava et al., 2022 )) took the ﬁrst step in inductive reasoning, we still hope to\nestablish a more systematic and comprehensive benchmark fo r evaluating this capability. Recently,\nBills et al. (2023 ) has tested the inductive ability of GPT-4 ( OpenAI, 2023 ) to evaluate its effectiveness\nin inducing patterns that are difﬁcult for humans to express clearly. Intriguingly, Mankowitz et al. (2023 )\nused some techniques to evaluate the extent to which LLM can m ine previously unknown patterns.\n2.2.4 Abduction Reasoning Competency\nAbduction Reasoning Competency encompasses the task of pro viding explanations for the output gen-\nerated based on given inputs ( Kakas and Michael, 2020 ). This form of reasoning is particularly critical\nin scenarios where uncertainty or incomplete information e xists, enabling systems to generate hypothe-\nses and make informed decisions based on the available evide nce. Notably, the research conducted\nby LIREx ( Zhao and Vydiswaran, 2021 ) and STaR ( Zelikman et al., 2022 ) delved into the Abduction\nReasoning Competency of models and demonstrated the effect iveness of rationales provided during the\nAbduction Reasoning process in facilitating improved lear ning in downstream models.\nIn terms of datasets within the LLM setting, the benchmarks H UMMINGBIRD ( Mathew et al., 2021 )\nand HateXplain ( Hayati et al., 2021 ) require models to output word-level textual segments as ex -\nplanations for sentiment classiﬁcation results. On the oth er hand, benchmarks such as Wik-\niQA ( Yang et al., 2015 ), HotpotQA ( Yang et al., 2018 ), and SciFact ( Wadden et al., 2020 ) provide\nsentence-level coarse-grained textual segments as explan ations for model classiﬁcation results.\nERASER ( DeYoung et al., 2020 ) and FineIEB ( Wang et al., 2022b ) provide benchmarks for evaluating\nAbduction Reasoning with diverse granularity explanation s. Based on previous research, Synthetic Rea-\nsoning ( Liang et al., 2022 ) provides a comprehensive evaluation of both Deduction Rea soning and Ab-\nduction Reasoning Competency. Moreover, Hessel et al. (2022 ) introduced the ﬁrst comprehensive mul-\ntimodal benchmark for testing Abduction Reasoning capabil ities, providing a solid foundation for future\nadvancements in this domain. Recently, Bills et al. (2023 ) evaluate GPT-4 by observing the activation of\nneurons in GPT-2 and offering explanations for the GPT-2’s o utputs. This research avenue also presents\na novel approach for exploring the future evaluation of Abdu ction Reasoning Competency.\n2.2.5 Analogical Reasoning Competency\nAnalogy reasoning competency encompasses the ability of re asoning by identifying and applying simi-\nlarities between diverse situations or domains. It is based on the assumption that similar cases or objects\ntend to exhibit common attributes or behaviors. By recogniz ing these similarities, analogy reasoning\nenables systems to transfer knowledge or experience from on e context to another ( Sinha et al., 2019 ;\nWei et al., 2022b ). This type of reasoning plays a vital role in problem-solvi ng, decision-making, and\nlearning from past experiences. A typical example is In-Con text-Learning ( Dong et al., 2023 ), where the\nmodel is required to perform analogical reasoning based on g iven contexts, which are evaluated based\non the ﬁnal analogical results.\nFor a better assessment and understanding of the model’s ana logical reasoning ability,\nBrown et al. (2020 ) introduces SAT Analogies as a test to evaluate LLM’s analog ical reasoning capa-\nbilities. In recent years, Authorship Veriﬁcation and ARC d atasets ( Srivastava et al., 2022 ) have also\nproposed evaluation benchmark that involve presenting con textual examples and requiring the model to\nproduce induced pattern-compliant results.

However, there remains no consensus whether LLMs can\nreally reason, or just simply produce a larger context that i ncreases the likelihood of correctly predicting\nthe missing tokens ( Mialon et al., 2023 ). Although ”reasoning” itself may currently be an excuse of\nlanguage, we can still objectively verify the reasoning per formance of LLMs through various reasoning\ncompetencies. Previous methods mainly focus on the divisio n of reasoning tasks. Yu et al. (2023 ) divides\nexisting evaluation tasks into three major categories, nam ely knowledge reasoning, symbolic reasoning,\nand mathematical reasoning, based on the type of logic and ev idence involved in the reasoning process.\nZhao et al. (2023 ) divides reasoning tasks into deductive reasoning and defe asible reasoning according\nto the reasoning form. In this section, we decompose the reas oning competency into 6 sub-parts from\nthe perspective of model competency, providing a comprehen sive overview of existing research efforts\nand suggesting potential future directions. And Table 2presents some datasets for evaluating LLM’s\nreasoning competency using this categorization approach.\n2.2.1 Causal Reasoning Competency\nCausal reasoning competency is a highly signiﬁcant cogniti ve ability aimed at inferring causal-\nity through the observation of cause-effect relationships (V owels et al., 2023 ;D¨ undar-Coecke, 2022 ;\nChan et al., 2023 ). It enables us to comprehend and explain the relationships between events, variables,\nand actions, ultimately empowering us to make informed pred ictions and decisions ( Gao et al., 2023 ).\nThe benchmarks Causal-TimeBank ( Mirza et al., 2014 ), StoryLine ( Caselli and V ossen, 2017 ), and\nMA VEN-ERE ( Wang et al., 2022c ) aim to test the existence of causal relationships between t wo events\nin sentences. COPA ( Gordon et al., 2012 ) and XCOPA ( Ponti et al., 2020 ) are evaluation benchmarks\nfor extracting causal relationships in sentences, consist ing of a set of premises and possible causes or\neffects. Tested systems are required to apply commonsense k nowledge to identify the correct answers.\ne-CARE ( Du et al., 2022 ) and CALM-Bench ( Dalal et al., 2023 ) introduce a set of causal querying tasks\nto evaluate models, which include a cause and several potent ial effect sentences. Additionally, an anno-\ntated and interpretable causal reasoning dataset is provid ed for these tasks.\n2.2.2 Deduction Reasoning Competency\nIn the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), deductive reason ing abilities serve as the foundational\nskills for logical reasoning ( Evans, 2002 ). Unlike traditional rule-based deductive reasoning syst ems, it\ninvolves deriving speciﬁc conclusions or answers from gene ral and universally applicable premises using\ngiven rules and logic. Speciﬁcally, it manifests as a proces s of Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought utilizing\ngiven rules ( Lyu et al., 2023 ;Kojima et al., 2022 ). For instance, ( Kojima et al., 2022 ) introduced the\n“Let’s think step by step” prompt technique to better evalua te the Deduction Reasoning Competency.\nCurrent testing of this ability often intertwines with othe r skills and still lacks an independent evalu-\nation on typical text ( Clark et al., 2020 ) and symbol-related ( Wu et al., 2021 ) deductive datasets. How-\never, in general, almost all QA tasks can be explicitly evalu ated for Deduction Reasoning using the\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) approach. Therefore, the effectiv eness of models’ Deduction Reasoning Com-\npetency can be to some extent reﬂected by evaluating the perf ormance of QA tasks after applying the\nCoT method.']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '2308.07902v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2308.07902v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 280723, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2308.07902v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2308.07902v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 280723, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How does EE-LLM use 3D parallelism to tackle computational overhead and KV caching in early-exit LLMs?,"['1.2 Challenges\nThe first and foremost question is how to train an early-exit LLM that is too large to fit into the memory of\none single device (e.g. GPU). While state-of-the-art frameworks like Megatron-LM [67, 49, 36], DeepSpeed\n[58, 68], Mesh-TensorFlow [65], Alpa [92], InternLM [72], and many more, support training standardLLMsat\nlargescaleswithdataparallelismandmodelparallelism(includingtensor, sequenceandpipelineparallelism),\nthey do not provide native support for early-exit LLMs. One particular challenge lies in pipeline parallelism\n[47,48,20,41], whichpartitionsthemodelalongthedepthdimensionintomultiplepipelinestages, connected\nby limited point-to-point communication between devices; this seems to contradict with early-exit models,\nas the early-exit training loss is typically an aggregation of losses for multiple (early or final) exits that are\nnow located separately on different pipeline stages. Despite the necessity of pipeline parallelism in many\nscenarios, we are not aware of any implementation that supports training early-exit LLMs with pipeline\nparallelism.\nMoreover, training efficiency for early-exit LLMs requires special design. While sizes of early-exit layers\nare often regarded as negligible for many neural network architectures, this is not the case for LLMs, where\neach early exit contains (at least) a large output embedding matrix that transforms hidden states into\nlogits on the vocabulary. A naive implementation of early-exit LLM training can cause large computational\noverhead compared to standard LLM training.\nFinally,withregardstoautoregressivegenerationtasks(wheretokensaregeneratedonebyone,depending\nonpreviouslygeneratedtokensviatheattentionmechanism), anaiveimplementationofearly-exitinferenceis\nnot compatible with KV caching, a standard technique of storing the keys and values of previously generated\ntokens at each layer. More specifically, if the current token is generated via early exiting at some layer, then\nits KV caches in later layers are missing, which hinders the generation of future tokens. Given that KV\ncaching is enabled by default in most cases, the efficacy of early exiting for autoregressive generation might\nbe questionable if its conflict with KV caching is not well resolved.\n1.3 Main contributions\nWe propose EE-LLM, a system for large-scale training and inference of early-exit (EE) LLMs with 3D par-\nallelism, which is designed to tackle the aforementioned challenges. EE-LLMis built upon Megatron-LM\n[67, 49, 36, 68], and augments it with various functionalities for early exiting.

It is typically composed of an input embedding layer, a stack of\nTransformer layers, and finally an output layer. Each Transformer layer consists of cross-attention and/or\nself-attention modules [4, 34, 52], a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and layer normalization (LayerNorm\n[2] or RMSNorm [88]). Transformers can be categorized into three types: encoder-only, encoder-decoder,\nand decoder-only. For the latter two, there is an output embedding matrix in the output layer, which\n3', '𝜽!𝒙!𝒐""𝜽#𝒙#𝜽""𝒙""Input𝝓!𝝓#𝝓""𝒐#𝒐!Early-exit layersFigure 1: The model architecture of an early-exit LLM. New components related to early exiting, which are\nabsent from a standard LLM, are highlighted in blue color. In this figure, each θirepresents a sequence of\nTransformer layers in the backbone of the LLM (with some additional modules in θ1for input processing);\nin addition, each ϕirepresents an early-exit or final-output layer that converts the hidden state xiinto an\noutput oi, e.g. logits for next-token prediction.\ntransforms hidden states into logits on a (typically large) vocabulary that can be used for generating tokens.\nAn LLM can be learned by unsupervised pre-training, e.g. minimizing the negative log-likelihood of next-\ntoken prediction on a large corpus [55, 56]. In this work, we focus on the decoder-only generative pre-training\n(GPT)Transformerarchitecture[55,56], thoughmanyofourideasarewidelyapplicabletootherTransformer\narchitectures or generic deep neural networks.\n2.2 Early-exit LLMs\nAs mentioned earlier, an early-exit neural network can be obtained by adding to a standard nerual network\nsome early-exit layers that turn intermediate hidden states into early outputs [81, 63]. During inference for\na given input, the model starts a forward pass and decides (at each early exit) whether to return an output\nor continue forwarding via certain rules, e.g. to return an output whenever the confidence of prediction is\nabove a pre-defined threshold [63, 61].\nThe standard way of training an early-exit model is to minimize a weighted sum of early-exit and final-\nexit training losses [63, 61]. Note that early-exit layers bring additional computational overhead to training.\nThis is especially the case for LLMs, primarily due to the large output embedding matrix of size h×V\nwithin each early-exit layer, where his the hidden dimension and Vis the vocabulary size. We call an early-\nexit layer minimalistic if it has the same structure as the final output layer of the GPT model architecture\n[55, 56], which includes an output embedding matrix, plus an optional LayerNorm/RMSNorm in front of it.\nAdditional modules can be added to early-exit layers for increased expressivity and adaptivity of early exits.\n2.3 Megatron-LM and 3D parallelism\nMegatron-LM [67, 49, 36, 68] is one of the state-of-the-art systems for large-scale training of LLMs with\n3D parallelism on a massive number of GPUs. With data parallelism , each GPU handles the forward and\nbackward computation for one part of the data batch, and then the results are aggregated at the end of the\ntraining iteration. When the model is too large to fit in a single GPU, model partitioning becomes necessary\nand can be used in conjunction with data parallelism. With tensor (and sequence) parallelism , each large\nmodule (e.g. a linear layer) is divided into multiple pieces that are assigned to different GPUs, so that each\ncomputational task related to it (e.g. large matrix multiplication) can be divided into smaller tasks and\nsolved in parallel. One major limitation with tensor (and sequence) parallelism is that it requires expensive\ncollective communication such as all-reduce operations, and thus is only viable for high-end GPUs within\nthe same computing node, with high-bandwidth communication among them.\nPipeline parallelism [47, 48, 20, 41], on the other hand, partitions a deep model along the depth dimension\ninto multiple pipeline stages. Moreover, each data batch is divided into multiple microbatches, and their\nforward/backwardcomputationaltasksarescheduledamongthosemultiplepipelinestages. Morespecifically,\neach stage performs the forward computation for each microbatch and sends the resulted hidden states to\nanother stage; later on, it performs the backward computation for the same microbatch after receiving\nthe gradients of the training objective with respect to the sent hidden states.

How do fine-tuned LLMs compare to traditional models in user rating prediction?,"['Do LLMs Understand User Preferences? Evaluating LLMs On User Rating Prediction 3\n•We show that zero-shot LLMs still fall behind traditional recommender models that utilize human interaction data.\nZero-shot LLMs only achieve comparable performance than two surprisingly trivial baselines that always predicts the\naverage item or user rating. Furthermore, they significantly underperform traditional supervised recommendation\nmodels, indicating the importance of user interaction data.\n•Through numerous experiments that fine-tune LLMs on human interaction data, we demonstrate that fine-tuned\nLLMs can achieve comparable or even better performance than traditional models with only a small fraction of the\ntraining data, showing its promise in data efficiency.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Use of Natural Language in Recommender System\nOne of the earliest works that explored formulating the recommendation problem as a natural language task is [ 44]. They\nused BERT [ 6] and GPT-2 [ 25] on the Movielens dataset [ 12] to show that such language models perform surprisingly\nwell, though not as good as well tuned baselines like GRU4Rec [15].\nP5 [8] fine-tunes a popular open-sourced T5 [ 27] model, unifying both ranking, retrieval and other tasks like summary\nexplanation into one model. M6-Rec [ 5] is another related work, but they tackle the CTR prediction task by finetuning\na LLM called M6 [17].\nTwo recent works explore the use of LLMs for zero-shot prediction. ChatRec [ 7] handles zero-shot prediction as well\nas being interactive and providing explanations. [ 35] takes a three-stage prompting approach to generate next item\nrecommendation in the Movielens dataset and achieves competitive metrics, although not being able to beat strong\nsequential recommender baselines such as SASRec [16].\n2.2 Large Language Models\nOnce people realized that scaling up sizes of data and model helps language models, there has been a series of large\nlanguage models proposed and built: e.g. PaLM [ 2], GPT-3 [ 1] and recent ones such as OPT [ 43] and LLaMA [ 33]. One\nof the unique abilities of LLMs has been in their ability to reason about things, which is further improved by techniques\nsuch as chain-of-thought prompting [41], self-consistency [38] and self-reflection [30].\nAnother major strong capability of LLMs is instruction following that models can generalize to unseen tasks by\nfollowing the given natural language instructions. Researchers have found that techniques like instruction fine-tuning\n[4] and RLHF [ 3] can significantly improve LLMs’ capability to perform tasks given natural language descriptions\nthat align with human’s preferences. As one of the tasks that can be described in natural language, ‘recommendation’\nhas become a promising new capability for LLMs. In this work, we focus on the models that have been fine-tuned to\nimprove their instruction following capability such as ChatGPT [ 23], GPT-3 (text-davinci-003 [ 22]), Flan-U-PaLM and\nFlan-T5 [4].\n3 METHOD\n3.1 Problem formulation\nWe study the task of user rating prediction, formulated as: Given a user 𝑢∈U , a sequence of user 𝑢’s historical\ninteractions 𝐸𝑢={𝑒𝑢\n1,𝑒𝑢\n2,...,𝑒𝑢𝑛}and an item 𝑖∈I, predict the rating that the user 𝑢will give to the item 𝑖, where the\nuser historical interaction sequence 𝐸𝑢is ordered by time ( 𝑒𝑢𝑛is the most recent item that the user consumed), and each\nManuscript submitted to ACM', 'Do LLMs Understand User Preferences? Evaluating LLMs On User Rating Prediction 9\ndata. This is probably because that even average rating of all items has a relatively low RMSE, and thus as long as a\nmodel learns to predict a rating near the average rating, it could achieve reasonable performance. For AUC the trend\nis more clear, as simply predicting average rating results in an AUC of 0.5. We found that a small fraction of data is\nrequired for LLM to achieve good performance, while Transformer+MLP needs much more training data (at least 1\nepoch) for convergence.\n5 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of large language models as a recommendation system for user rating\nprediction in three settings: 1. zero-shot; 2. few-shot; and 3. fine-tuning. Compared to traditional recommender methods,\nour results revealed that LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot LLMs fall behind fully supervised methods, implying the\nimportance of incorporating the target dataset distribution into LLMs. On the other hand, fine-tuned LLMs can largely\nclose the gap with carefully designed baselines in key metrics. LLM-based recommenders have several benefits: (i) better\ndata efficiency; (ii) simplicity for feature processing and modeling: we only need to convert information into a prompt\nwithout manually designing feature processing strategies, embedding methods, and network architectures to handle\nvarious kind of information; (iii) potential for unlock conversational recommendation capabilities. Our work sheds light\non the current status of LLM-based recommender systems, and in the future we will further look into improving the\nperformance via methods like prompt tuning, and explore novel recommendation applications enabled by LLMs.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Tom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D Kaplan, Prafulla Dhariwal, Arvind Neelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry,\nAmanda Askell, et al. 2020.

We regard the implementation\nof traditional speculative decoding mentioned by previous\nwork [3] as the baseline ( De f ault ) and choose the specula-\ntion length consistent with it (i.e. 4). We first employ diverse\nSSMs with a majority-voted speculator ( Majority ) on the\nbasis of Default . As shown in Figure 10, for OPT-13B and\nLlama-70B-chat, Majority can bring an increment of 9.56%\nand 59.82% on throughput. This is mainly because Majority\nunifies the capabilities of multiple SSMs without incurring\nadditional verification overhead. For OPT-13B, the increase\nis not as substantial as Llama2-70B-chat. The reason is that\nits employed SSMs exhibit comparable capabilities on the\nfinance dataset, thus the combined advantage of their collabo-\nration is weakened.\nBased on Majority , we further demonstrate the effective-\nness of adaptive speculation length selector ( Selector ). Specif-\nically, it delivers extra throughput increments of 35.07% and\n5.91% on OPT-13B and Llama2-70B-chat, respectively. The\nmain reason is that Selector can dynamically adjust the spec-\nulation length to bring it closer to the optimum, greatly bal-\nancing the verified length and verification cost of LLM. For\nLlama2-70B-chat, the rise is not significant compared to OPT-\n13B. The reason is that the default speculation length is very\nclose to the optimum. As a result, only a minimal optimization\nspace remains for Selector .\nBased on Majority andSelector , we further consider the\neffectiveness of the speculative generation pipeline ( Pipeline ).\nFor OPT-13B and Llama-70B-chat, it additionally brings an\nincrease of 34.27% and 55.37% on throughput. This is mainly\nbecause Pipeline decouples the execution of SSM decoding\nand LLM verification, effectively reducing the idle time dur-\ning the inference with improved throughput.5.4 Effectiveness of Design Choices\nEffectiveness of Majority-voted Speculator - To demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of our proposed majority-voted spec-\nulator, we evaluate Minions with the implementations using\nonly one kind of SSM, respectively recorded as SSM1, SSM2,\nand SSM3. The batch size we use is 16. The detailed evalua-\ntion results are shown in Figure 11, where the bars indicate\nthe throughput of each evaluated employment, and the cir-\ncled dots are the acceptance rates. As shown in Figure 11,\nin all diverse model and dataset configurations, Minions is\nable to achieve throughput comparable to, or even higher than\nthe optimal throughput in SSM1, SSM2, and SSM3. The rea-\nson is that through the majority-voted mechanism, Minions\ncan leverage the collective wisdom of multiple SSMs under\na dataset by adjusting weights based on runtime feedback.\nThe results of the acceptance rate further demonstrate this\npoint. As shown in Figure 11, for OPT-13B, Minions is able\nto achieve acceptance rates of 0.87, 0.89, and 0.78 on finance ,\nchatbot , and dialogue respectively. For Llama-70B-chat, Min-\nions is able to achieve acceptance rates of 0.54, 0.49, and 0.55\nonfinance ,chatbot , and dialogue respectively.\nEffectiveness of Adaptive Speculation Length Selector -\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of our adaptive mechanism to\ndynamically adjust the speculation length ( s) of SSMs, we\ncompare Minions with the implementations with fixed srang-\ning from 2 to 12. The batch size we use is 16. Particularly,\nwe leverage the red line to represent the highest throughput\nacross all steps, regarding it as the optimality. As shown in\nFigure 12, in all diverse model and dataset configurations,\nMinions consistently achieve high throughput that closely ap-\nproaches the optimality and outperforms others.

The experiment setups are the same as\nSection 5.1 with a batch size of 32. As shown in Figure 13, for\nOPT-13B, Minions achieves a speedup of 7.61 × ∼ 14.49×on\nthroughout and 6.34 × ∼ 8.89×on latency. The main reason\nis that Minions efficiently pipelines the execution of SSM\nand LLM and achieves a high acceptance rate across different\ndatasets via a majority-voted speculator and adaptive specula-\ntion length selector. Moreover, the performance of SpecInfer\nis far below what is reported in the paper [25]. We suspect\nthe poor performance can be attributed to the problematic\noperator implementations1. We have also tried to compare\nwith it on Llama2-70B-chat model. However, it fails to load\nthe attention weights of the model.\n1https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow/issues/12405.6 Overhead Analysis\nThe overhead of Minions can be divided into three parts, in-\ncluding monitored data fitting (MDF ),tree-based weighted\nmajority decision (TMD ), and SSMs weights update (SWU ).\nMDF performs linear fitting on monitored data. TMD con-\nstructs a tree based on the outputs of SSMs and selects the\nmajority-approved output token by token. SWU calculates the\nacceptance rate for each request and rewards or punishes the\nweight of the corresponding SSM based on a preset threshold.\nAs illustrated in Figure 14, the overhead incurred by MDF ,\nTMD andSWU is at most 2.37% of the total inference time,\nwhich is negligible compared to the inference process.\n6 Related Work\nRecent work has proposed a series of optimization techniques,\nwhich can be categorized into two types: system optimizations\nand algorithm optimizations.\nLLM system optimizations - With the emergence of LLM\ninference, there have been many efforts to build efficient LLM\ninference systems [16, 18, 27, 31, 40, 46, 50]. Orca [50] pro-\nposes iteration-level scheduling, which lowers the scheduling\ngranularity from the request level to the iteration level. Draw-\ning inspiration from virtual memory and paging techniques\nin operating systems, vLLM [18] introduces the PagedAtten-\ntion to manage KVCache. TGI [16] introduces a new model\nserialization format safetensor to store the LLM weights. It is\nfaster and more secure compared to other serialization formats.\nDeepSpeed-FastGen [27] presents a token composition strat-\negy called Dynamic SplitFuse, which further improves contin-\nuous batching and system throughput. TensorRT-LLM [31] is\nbuilt on the inference framework TensorRT and can perform\ncompilation optimizations such as kernel fusion and kernel\n11']","MVS (Majority-voted Speculator) increases OPT-13B's throughput by 9.56% and ASLS (Adaptive Speculation Length Selector) delivers an extra throughput increment of 35.07%.

How do deferred forward computations in early-exit layers affect training efficiency and memory in a 7B GPT Transformer with pipeline parallelism?,"['1 2 3 4\nPipeline stage5.05.25.45.65.86.0Forward time (s)\nStandard LLM\nEarly-exit LLM\n1 2 3 4\nPipeline stage10.010.410.811.2Backward time (s)\nStandard LLM\nEarly-exit LLM\n1 2 3 4\nPipeline stage40485664GPU memory (GB)\nStandard LLM\nEarly-exit LLMFigure 4: The forward time, backward time, and peak GPU memory of each pipeline stage for a standard\n7B GPT Transformer, as well as its early-exit version that has one minimalistic early-exit layer (without\nlayer normalization) added to each middle stage. Degrees of pipeline, tensor and data parallelism are 4, 1,\nand 1, respectively; the microbatch size is 2, global batch size is 128, and sequence length is 2048. Note that\nthe forward computation of early-exit layers has been deferred to the backward steps, hence not included in\n“forward time” of the first plot, but in “backward time” of the second plot.\n•If possible, add early exits to the middle stages rather than to the first or last one. For example,\nadding one early exit to the end of the first stage leads to the same model architecture as adding to\nthe beginning of the second stage, but the latter has higher training efficiency due to more balanced\nload across stages.\n•Avoid adding too many early exits to the LLM. Despite higher flexibility during inference, the gain\nof adding many early exits (e.g. one per layer) might be marginal, and comes at the cost of excessive\noverhead for training and inference, which is especially the case for LLMs due to large vocabulary sizes.\nSimilar observations and advice have been made recently by the authors of [3] as well.\n•If there are multiple exits within the same pipeline stage, one might use the same output embedding\nmatrix for all exits; similarly, if early exits are added to the first/last stage, one might reuse the\noriginal input/output embedding matrix for early exits. These choices reduce the memory usage by\nmodel parameters, at the cost of lower expressivity of early exits.\nRemark 3.Recall from Section 3.1 that, with EE-LLM, users can choose more expressive and powerful early-\nexit layers beyond the minimalistic structure. Similarly, more than one early exit can be added to each\npipeline stage, which provides more flexible choices of exits during inference. These benefits, of course, come\nat the cost of higher overhead for training, and potentially for inference as well4; with EE-LLM, users can\nconveniently choose the most suitable configurations for their own use cases. We refer interested readers to\nAppendix A for formal analysis of training efficiency in these general cases.\nNumerical examples. We complement previous analytical study with a few numerical examples. Fig-\nure 4 illustrates load imbalance in the original 1F1B pipeline schedule for a standard 7B GPT Transformer,\nas well as the impacts of adding one minimalistic early-exit layer to each middle stage (with all perfor-\nmance optimizations applied). Table 1 takes a close look at the impacts of each performance optimization;\nunsurprisingly, the best training efficiency is achieved with all the proposed optimizations applied.\n4.3 Advanced features\nEE-LLMincorporates some advanced features that can potentially improve the training process, which are\nintroduced below. We note that these are exploratory functionalities, and formal investigation of their\npractical benefits is left for future work.\n4There is no clear answer to whether additional modules at early-exit layers will improve or hurt the overall inference\nspeed. There is certainly higher overhead for the computation of each early-exit layer; on the other hand, higher flexibility\nand adaptivity of the early exits can potentially enable them to produce better outputs and get selected more often during\ninference, leading to overall faster generation of a complete sequence. For similar reasons, there is no clear positive or negative\ncorrelation between the number of early exits and the overall speed of generating a sequence.\n11', 'EarlyExitTransformerLayer is a replacement for the original ParallelTransformerLayer in Megatron-\nLM. It adds an early-exit structure on top of the standard Transformer layer, which allows it to generate\noutputs for both the main network backbone and the early exit; for the latter, it returns a lazy loss function\nduring training, or tokens during inference. This module supports various customizations of the early-exit\nstructure; besides the minimalistic structure with an output embedding matrix and an optional output\nnormalization layer, one might add e.g. a MLP or a complete Transformer layer. These additional structures\ncan be combined in any desired manner and can be placed before or after the backbone part of this layer.\nOn the other hand, EarlyExitTransformer and EarlyExitLanguageModel are mainly used to propagate\nthe early-exit outputs to the top-level model. They are capable of stopping the forward computation at the\nearly-exit layer and returning the intermediate outputs, which facilitates accelerated inference.\n6.2 Pipeline scheduling\nWe have adjusted the existing 1F1B schedule for early-exit LLMs, as shown in Figure 3. To fill implicit\nbubbles and reduce GPU memory overhead, lazy loss functions of early-exit layers are returned together with\noutputs of the backbone network during forward steps. These lazy functions are not actually called until\ntheir corresponding auxiliary losses (cf. Section 4.1.1) are calculated in the backward steps. For the method\nof filling explicit bubbles proposed in Section 4.3.2, we have inserted partial forward/backward computation\nof additional microbatches into warm-up and cool-down phases of the 1F1B schedule. The number of inserted\nmicrobatchesandpartialforward/backwardstagescanbeautomaticallycalculatedthroughtheuser-specified\n(estimate of) ratio between backward and forward time.\n6.3 Inference service\nTo support inference of early-exit LLMs, we have refactored the text-generation module of Megatron-LM.\nFor inference with pipeline parallelism, i.e. the pipeline-based approach proposed in Section 5.2, we have\nre-implemented the forward process. With our implementation, the first pipeline stage will wait for an exit\nsignal from the early/final exits of all subsequent stages after its forward computation is completed. Each\nsubsequent stage will send an exit signal and the output token to the first stage, if there is an exit within\nthe stage that satisfies the exit condition. Upon receiving the signal and generated token, the first stage will\nimmediately start the forward pass for generating the next token. With this implementation, regardless of\nthe early-exit layers’ positions in subsequent stages, the inference service can immediately generate a token\nwhenever early exiting happens on some stage, without waiting for the completion of the entire stage (except\nfor the first stage).\nFor inference without pipeline parallelism, we have implemented a mechanism of KV recomputation ,\nwhich is a variant of synchronized parallel decoding proposed recently in [3]. In this approach, we maintain\na list of the most recent tokens that have missing KV caches in deep layers due to early exiting. During\neach forward pass, we include these early-exit tokens in the current forward pass, which allows for direct\nrecomputationoftheKVcachesforthesetokensandthusavoidstheissueofmissingKVcaches. Acceleration\nof sequence generation is still achieved, thanks to the batching effects of GPU computation. To avoid the\nendless accumulation of early-exit tokens, we enforce a full-model forward pass whenever the number of\nearly-exit tokens reaches a pre-specified value.\n7 Experiments\nThis section provides an empirical evaluation of the training and inference efficiency achieved by EE-LLM.\n7.1 Training\nIn the following experiments, we empirically investigate the convergence of training early-exit models with\nEE-LLM, as well as the training efficiency of EE-LLMfor early-exit LLMs up to an unprecedented scale of\n30B. This scale is only limited by the hardware resources available to us, namely an 8-node cluster with 8\n15']",Deferred forward computations in early-exit layers are not included in the 'forward time' but are included in the 'backward time'.

The CDM-engine discussed in this article addresses this by querying patients\nabout relevant symptoms. If a patient is aware of a symptom and responds accordingly, the engine integrate the\nLLM-question and patient’s responses into the patient-LLM dialog history. Revisit the process outlined in Figure 4 to\nevaluate the information.

As show in figure 6, this section describes the three steps to identify a flowchart:\n(1) collect medical books and filter out flowcharts; (2) Identify the basic shapes in the flowchart, connecting lines and\nwords, and restructure them into a flowchart; (3) manual verification of flow chart recognition results.\n6', 'MedDM:LLM-executable clinical guidance tree for clinical decision-making A P REPRINT\ncalibrators are established to cross-check and identify the completed flow chart to ensure that the relationship between\nnodes and connecting lines in the flow chart are correctly identified.\nFurthermore, to generate informative and accurate responses for medical diagnosis dialog, we propose a decision-\nretrieval based generation framework to handle medical decision-making knowledge.\nThis work makes the following contributions:\n•We identify a new challenge, that is, in medical diagnosis scenarios, current medical LLMs lacks specialization.\n•To mitigate this challenge, we propose a novel decision tree structure, namely LLM-executable clinical\nguidance tree, and collect a new medical decision-making dataset (MedDM).\n•We propose a decision-retrieval based generation framework to address the task. Experimental results show\nthe effectiveness of the method.\n2 Related Work\nThe clinical guidance tree [Turner, 2009] is an enhanced version of a decision tree employed in medical practice,\nutilizing a text-based representation method to define the guiding tree. [Li et al., 2022] recruited an annotation team to\nconstruct the Text2DT dataset based on rules authored by medical experts and extracted from medical literature, which\nemploys a binary tree as its representation, with node information being represented by triplets.\nFlowchart Recognition can be categorized into two major types: handwritten flowchart recognition and machine-\ngenerated flowchart recognition. Given that the medical literature collected for this study is in electronic PDF format,\nour focus is on machine-generated flowcharts. [Rusinol et al., 2012] and [Mörzinger et al., 2012] delineated flowchart\nrecognition into two tasks: text recognition and graphic recognition. They trained two separate models for detection.\nIn contrast, [Sun et al., 2022] proposed a multitask model based on the transformer architecture for identifying both\ntext and graphics, achieving end-to-end flowchart recognition. However, the current effectiveness of existing flowchart\nrecognition models in identifying connecting lines needs further improvement. Concurrently, we believe that mature\ntext recognition tools such as CnOCR can assist in enhancing the accuracy of text recognition.\nClinical decision support system assists physicians in patient consultations, offering guidance and recommendations.\nThe primary methods involve knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches. [Mei et al., 2011], based on clinical\nguidelines, developed a rule engine for managing chronic diseases. In order to provide personalized treatments, [Liu\net al., 2017] grouped electronic medical record data of atrial fibrillation patients, demonstrating effectiveness in real\ncases. Moreover, [Zhao et al., 2020], combining clinical guidelines and electronic medical record data, constructed a\nnested decision tree for grouping and treatment recommendations for patients with hyperthyroidism. Specifically, it\ninvolves firstly building a decision tree based on the clinical guides with rule-obeyed patient data, and then loading\nrule-uncovered patient data to further expand the tree.\n3 LLM-executable clinical guidance tree\n3.1 Defining LLM-executable CGT\nDue to the increasing emphasis on the importance of LLM participating in clinical diagnosis decision-making, clinical\nguidance trees for direct use by LLM are becoming more and more urgently needed. Therefore, we propose a CGT\nrepresentation that can be directly used by large language models—-LLM-executable CGT. Contrasting with the\ntraditional, regimented frameworks of clinical guidance and decision trees, we adopt natural language for a nuanced\nrepresentation of node content. This strategy enhances clarity in conveying each node’s information and offers direct\ncompatibility for use as prompts in large language models.\nWe define the LLM-executable CGT enhanced, semi-structured representation of a decision tree for clinical decision\nmaking which is LLM-friendly and capable of being interpreted and executed. Using this representation, LLM can\neasily follow decision pathway to make medical decisions. Compared with the traditional CGT, our CGT is a multi-tree\nstructure, which is only composed of root node, condition node and action node, as show in figure 2. The root node\nrepresents the core symptoms or the name of the disease. Conditional nodes are the non-leaf nodes of the multi-branch\ntree, signifying the conditions that need to be evaluated during the decision-making process. The action nodes, as the\nleaf nodes, represent the outcomes of the final decisions.\nCondition Node. Unlike the Text2DT Zhu et al.

"How do LLMs' self-assessment and pre-training data affect their performance in knowledge-heavy tasks, especially comparing parametric vs. retrieved knowledge?","['Survey on Factuality in Large Language Models 25\nindicate that LLMs possess an inaccurate perception of their factual knowledge boundaries and\ntend to be overly confident about their responses. LLMs often fail to fully harness the knowledge\nthey possess; however, retrieval enhancement can somewhat compensate for this shortcoming.\nYin et al . [292] introduce a dataset named “SelfAware"" to test if models recognize what they don’t\nknow, encompassing both answerable and unanswerable questions. The experiment suggests that\nmodels do possess some capacity to discern their own knowledge gaps, but they are still far from\nhuman levels. GPT-4 outperforms other models, instructions and In-Context-Learning [ 57] can\nenhance a model’s discriminatory ability. Kadavath et al . [120] focus on LLM self-assessment based\non Language Model calibration using multiple-choice questions. Their findings revealed that the\n""none of the above"" option decreased accuracy, larger models showed better calibration, and RLHF\nhindered model calibration levels. However, simply adjusting the temperature parameter can rectify\nthis issue. Azaria and Mitchell [6]assess the truthfulness of statements generated by LLMs, by\nusing the model’s internal state and hidden layer activations. The authors, employing a feedforward\nneural network, can classify if the model is misleading by utilizing the hidden output states.\nParametric Knowledge vs Retrieved Knowledge. Yu et al . [293] explore whether the internal\nknowledge of LLMs can replace the retrieved documents on knowledge-intensive tasks. They ask\nLLMs, such as InstructGPT, to directly generate contexts given a question rather than retrieving\nthem from the database. They find the generated documents contain the golden answers more\noften than the top retrieved documents. Then they feed the generated docs and retrieved docs to\nthe Fusion-in-Decoder model [ 109] for knowledge-intensive tasks such as Open-domain QA [ 128]\nand find the generated docs are more effective than the retrieved docs, suggesting that the LLMs\ncontain enough knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.\nOn the contrary, these observations have been contested in subsequent investigations. Kandpal\net al. [121] underscore the dependency of LLMs on the number of associated documents seen during\npre-training. They argue that the success in answering fact-based questions is highly linked to the\nnumber of documents containing the topic of the question that were encountered in pre-training.\nThe study further posited the necessity of scaling models extensively to achieve competitive\nperformance for questions with minimum representation in the training data. Adding to these\nconcerns, Sun et al . [239] critically evaluate the factual knowledge base of LLMs, using a specifically\ndesigned Head-to-Tail benchmark comprised of 18K question-answer pairs. The results show that\nthe understanding of factual knowledge, particularly related to torso-to-tail entities, by currently\navailable LLMs is suboptimal.\nIn summary, while LLMs show promise in handling knowledge-intensive tasks, their dependency\non pre-training information and limitations in factual accuracy remain significant hurdles. It\nunderscores the need for further advancements in the field and the importance of incorporating\ncomplementary methods, such as retrieval augmentation, to enhance the learning of long-tail\nknowledge in LLMs.\n4.1.3 Contextual Influence and Knowledge Conflict. This sub-subsection examines the interplay\nbetween an LLM’s inherent parametric knowledge and the provided contextual knowledge, explor-\ning both the model’s capacity to utilize context and its behavior when confronted with conflicting\ninformation.\nContextual Influence on Generation. Some works explore the model’s capacity to utilize context,\nfor example, Li et al . [135] observe that larger models tend to rely on their parametric knowledge,\neven when faced with counterfactual contexts. This suggests that as models increase in size, they\nmight grow more confident in their internal knowledge, potentially sidelining external context.\nHowever, the introduction of irrelevant contexts can still influence their outputs. The balance\nACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: December 2018.', 'Survey on Factuality in Large Language Models 27\net al. [279] highlight the inherent biases and limitations of LLMs. The overarching theme is the\nneed for a balanced approach, where LLMs effectively leverage both their internal knowledge and\nexternal context to produce accurate and coherent outputs.\n4.2 Causes of Factual Errors\nUnderstanding the root causes of these factual inaccuracies is crucial for refining these models\nand ensuring their reliable application in real-world scenarios. In this subsection, we delve into\nthe multifaceted origins of these errors, categorizing them based on the stages of model operation:\nModel Level, Retrieval Level, Generation Level, and other miscellaneous causes. Table 1 shows\nexamples of factuality errors caused by different factors.\n4.2.1 Model-level Causes. This subsection delves into the intrinsic factors within large language\nmodels that contribute to factual errors, originating from their inherent knowledge and capabilities.\nDomain Knowledge Deficit. The model may lack comprehensive expertise in specific domains,\nleading to inaccuracies. Every LLM has its limitations based on the data it was trained on. If an\nLLM hasn’t been exposed to comprehensive data in a specific domain during its training, it’s likely\nto produce inaccurate or generalized outputs when queried about that domain. For instance, while\nan LLM might be adept at answering general science questions, it might falter when asked about\nniche scientific subfields [161].\nOutdated Information. The model’s dependence on older datasets can make it unaware of recent\ndevelopments or changes. LLMs are trained on datasets that, at some point, become outdated. This\nmeans that any events, discoveries, or changes post-dating the last training update won’t be known\nto the model. For example, ChatGPT and GPT-4 are both trained on data up to 2021.09 might not\nbe aware of events or advancements after then.\nImmemorization. The model does not always retain knowledge from its training corpus. While\nit’s a misconception that LLMs “memorize"" data, they do form representations of knowledge based\non their training. However, they might not always recall specific, less-emphasized details from\ntheir training parameters, especially if such details were rare or not reinforced through multiple\nexamples. For example, ChatGPT has pretrained with Wikipedia, but it still fail in answering some\nquestions from NaturalQuestions [ 128] and TriviaQA [ 119], which are constructed from Wikipedia\n[263].\nForgetting. The model might not retain knowledge from its training phase or could forget prior\nknowledge as it undergoes further training. As models are further fine-tuned or trained on new\ndata, there’s a risk of “catastrophic forgetting"" [ 28,84,272,298] where they might lose certain\nknowledge they were previously know. This is a well-known challenge in neural network training,\nwhere networks forget previously learned information when exposed to new data, which also\nhappens in large language models [165].\nReasoning Failure. While the model might possess relevant knowledge, it can sometimes fail\nto reason with it effectively to answer queries. Even if an LLM has the requisite knowledge to\nanswer a question, it might fail to connect the dots or reason logically. For instance, ambiguity in\nthe input [ 151] can potentially lead to a failure in understanding by LLMs, consequently resulting\nin reasoning errors. In addition, Berglund et al . [13] find the LLM traps in the reversal curse, for\nexample, it knows that A is B’s mother but fail to answer who is B’s son. This is especially evident\nin complex multi-step reasoning tasks or when the model needs to infer based on a combination of\nfacts [126, 244].\nACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .

This improvement is attributed\nto few-shot learning, which allows LLMs to better\ngrasp the characteristics and patterns of misinfor-\nmation. As a result, few-shot learning can steadily\nenhance LLMs’ performance in misinformation\ndetection tasks\n4 Enhancing LLMs to Understand Text\nand Propagation for Better Detection\nBased on the above empirical analysis, we observe\nthe unsatisfactory performance of LLMs for both\ntext and propagation-based misinformation detec-\ntion. To enhance the understanding of text and\npropagation for LLMs, in this section, we design\ntwo instruction-tuned strategies for improving text-\nbased detection (Section 4.1), and two instruction-tuned strategies for improving propagation-based\ndetection (Section 4.2). Then, we experimented to\nshow the effectiveness of them for misinformation\ndetection (Section 4.3).\n4.1 Two Tuned Strategies for Improving\nText-based Misinformation Detection\nWe endeavor to enhance few-shot learning by ex-\nploring improvements in the quantity of samples.\nSpecifically, we focus on refining the method of\npresenting samples in prompt and the selection for\nsamples.\nAlternating Sample Learning From previous\nempirical results, we find that original few-shot\nlearning, where samples of fake news are presented\nbefore samples of real news, may contribute to\nLLMs’ hallucinations. LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo as an\nexample) usually employ the Transformer architec-\nture (Ouyang et al., 2022). The Transformer frame-\nwork utilizes self-attention mechanisms, making\nit sensitive to the order of input sequences and en-\nabling it to capture long-range dependencies within\nthese sequences. Therefore, in this task, this mech-\nanism can assist the model in grasping the associa-\ntions between positive and negative samples. In the\noriginal few-shot learning, LLMs are unable to ef-\nfectively learn the distinction between positive and\nnegative samples since they had not encountered\npositive samples while learning negative ones, i.e.,\nthe classification boundary. When dealing with true\nnews samples, the previously accumulated nega-\ntive example information might cause interference.\nBy alternately inputting positive and negative sam-\nples, LLMs can better capture the key features of\neach category during the continuous adjustment of\nclassification boundaries, thereby enhancing classi-\nfication accuracy.\nTherefore, we attempt to mitigate LLMs’ hal-\nlucination by alternating the presentation of fake\nand real news samples in the prompt, as shown in\nFigure 5. The instruction consists of three parts,\nincluding task description, N-shot samples, and\ntask-related query. For N-shot samples, instead of\ngiving positive and negative samples directly, we\ngive them alternately. It helps LLMs to learn the\npotential interactions between positive and negative\nexamples for better prediction.\nHard Sample Learning We observe that the se-\nlection of samples in the few-shot learning can\nsignificantly impact the model’s judgments. Con-\nsequently, we design a hard sample learning (HSL)', 'Figure 5: The alternating sample learning strategy to enhance the understanding ability of LLMs for misinformation\ndetection.\n(a) Use LLMs to make predictions on samples within the\ntraining dataset.\n(b) If the predicted labels consistently differ from the ground-\ntruth labels, the sample is deemed as a hard sample.\nFigure 6: The hard sample learning strategy to improve\nLLMs for misinformation detection, where yrefers to\nthe ground-truth label, and ˆyirepresents the predicted\nlabel by LLMs given the i-th prompt.\nstrategy, which aims to curate representative sam-\nples that facilitate rapid learning and adaptation for\nLLMs during few-shot learning.\nThe process of hard samples learning strategy\nis shown in Figure 6.

Due to the meta-\nlearning capabilities of LLMs, they can leverage\nthe ability to quickly adapt to new tasks with mini-\nmal data (Ouyang et al., 2022).

Overall, AgentLM exhibits\nsignificant improvements over Llama 2 series different scales in both held-in and held-out tasks,\nwhile maintaining performance on general tasks. Although the improvement on the held-in tasks is\nmore pronounced than on the held-out tasks, the enhancement in the held-out tasks still reaches up\nto 170%. This results demonstrates the potential of our model as a general agent. On several tasks,\nthe 13B and 70B versions of AgentLM even surpassed GPT-4.\nFor most of the held-in tasks, the performance of Llama 2 is nearly zero, indicating that the model\nis entirely incapable of handling these tasks. Detailed error analysis in the following subsection (Cf.\nSection 3.3) reveals that the majority of mistakes are elementary errors, such as invalid instructions\nor repetitions. AgentLM, on the other hand, commits notably fewer elementary errors, indicating\nthat our approach effectively activates the agent capabilities of the model. Remarkably, the 70B\nAgentLM demonstrates performance nearly approaching GPT-4 overall.\nOn the held-out tasks, the 70B AgentLM demonstrates performance close to that of GPT-3.5. Fur-\nthermore, we observed a significantly larger improvement in the 70B model (+176%) compared to\nthe 7B model (+76%). We believe this is because larger models possess stronger generalization\ncapabilities, allowing them to better generalize to held-out tasks with the same train data.\nOn general tasks, AgentLM performs on par with Llama 2 across four dimensions: knowledge,\nmathematics, coding, and human preferences. This sufficiently demonstrates that our model main-\ntains the same general capabilities even with enhanced agent abilities.\n3.3 E RROR ANALYSIS\nTo delve into error analysis, we selected three tasks from the held-in set (ALFWorld, WebShop,\nKnowledge Graph) and identified common error types using a rule-based approach, such as invalid\nactions and repeated generations. The results can be seen in Figure 3a. Overall, the original Llama\n2 exhibited more elementary mistakes like repetition or taking invalid actions. In contrast, GPT-3.5\nand especially GPT-4 made fewer of such errors. However, the AgentLM noticeably reduced these\nbasic errors.

How does SummEval ensure factual accuracy in CNN/DailyMail summaries?,"['ALLURE\n5 EXPERIMENT 2: AUDITING TEXT SUMMARIZATION\nIn this section, we evaluate the factual correctness of the summarization.

We focus on the factual correctness of the summary, given\nby the consistency score. We consider a summary to be factually incorrect if the consistency score is less than 2.5,\notherwise it is factually correct. We select the summaries generated by GPT-2, T5, Pegasus and Improve-abs1. Given the\ndocument and its summary, we use GPT-4 for evaluation.

We found\nthat with 4 or more demonstration examples, the accuracy does improve for the evaluator.\n1https://github.com/Yale-LILY/SummEval\n11', 'You will be given a news article. You will then be given one summary written for this article.Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, andrefer to it as needed.Evaluation Criteria:Consistency (1-5) -the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Annotators were also asked to penalize summaries that contained hallucinated facts. Evaluation Steps:1. Read the news article carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.2. Read the summary and compare it to the article. Check if the summary contains any factual errors that are not supported by the article.3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.Example:Source Text: {{Document}}Summary: {{Summary}}Evaluation Form (scores ONLY):-Consistency:Figure 5: G-Eval prompt for assessing consistency in Summeval taken from https://github.com/nlpyang/geval .\nWhen adapted to TopicalChat, the word ’summary’ is replaced with ’dialogue’ and further minor details are changed\nfor specific attributes\nFigure 6: Comparative assessment prompts based on the simple ones used in (Liusie et al., 2023). displayed is a\nprompt for coherency assessment, however different adjectives can be used for different attributes.']","SummEval ensures factual accuracy in CNN/DailyMail summaries by using human ratings on the consistency score, which evaluates the factual alignment between the summary and the source document.

How do transition categories and finetuning frequency affect Jericho benchmark metrics?,"['1.Does including the language model in the\ntraining loop improve performance?\n2.Does LM-in-the-Loop mitigate the reliance\non human gameplay transitions?\n3.Should the transitions be categorized for im-\nproved learning?\n4.Can we make LM itself a policy network with-\nout DRRN with LM-in-the-Loop?\n5.Does training LM-in-the-Loop affect general-\nization to other games?\n5.1 Task Adaptation Dataset\nClubFloyd dataset (Yao et al., 2020) is a collection\nof crawled data from the ClubFloyd website. The\ndataset comprises of gameplay from experienced\nplayers; however, they may not be familiar with\nthe particular games. The data is preprocessed and\ncontains around 217Kpairs of context an in the\nform of ((oj−1, aj−1, oj), aj).\n5.2 Benchmark and the Metric\nJericho (Hausknecht et al., 2020) is a learning en-\nvironment that supports human-written interactive\nfiction games as described in Figure 1. We chose\n10games based on the diversity in the challenges\nfaced in each game such as large action space, so-\nlution length, and reward sparsity as mentioned in\nHausknecht et al. (2020). We use the average of\nthe last 100-episodes’ score with standard error for\nindividual games (Hausknecht et al., 2020) as our\nmetric for evaluation.\nIn addition, we report the average score normal-\nized (avg. norm) against the maximum score pos-\nsible in each of the games, which estimates the\nhuman-machine gap in text-based games. Finally,\nwe also report the relative performance percent-\nage difference between the baseline and the best\napproach mentioned as ∆% in Table 1 to capture\nthe improvement as the range of the scores in each\ngame is different.\n5.3 Model Details\nLanguage model (GPT-2) is first finetuned\non ClubFloyd dataset. Given the context,\n(oj−1, aj−1, oj), the finetuned GPT-2 proposes ac-\ntion candidates for DRRN to choose. Following\nthat, every action candidate and context is encoded\nwith a GRU. Then a decoder combines the represen-\ntations to estimate the Q-value using a multilayerPerceptron (MLP) and updates the DRRN agent\nparameter Φ. During the training process of the\nDRRN agents, the context-action pairs are stored\nin the replay buffers.

Table 5\ncompares the different methods detailed in §4.1\nwith reproduced norm score of CALM (Yao et al.,\n2020) as the baseline.

We simplify\nthis approach by maintaining a single buffer, Din\nplace of two. This is a weaker baseline than other\nheuristics to select useful transitions based on their\nimportance.\nState Feature Categorized (OC): In this, the\ntransitions are labeled as useful or not based on\nwhether an action atresulted in reward increase or\nif the agent’s location changed. i.e.,moved from\none room to another.

How does adversarial decoupling and probing-based training improve LLM summary accuracy?,"['Improving Factual Consistency of Text Summarization by Adversarially\nDecoupling Comprehension and Embellishment Abilities of LLMs\nHuawen Feng1,2∗, Yan Fan2, Xiong Liu2, Ting-En Lin2, Zekun Yao1,\nYuchuan Wu2, Fei Huang2, Yongbin Li2†, Qianli Ma1†\n1School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, China\n2Alibaba Group\n541119578@qq.com ,99722503@qq.com ,qianlima@scut.edu.cn\n{fanyan.fy,peter.lx,ting-en.lte,shengxiu.wyc,f.huang,shuide.lyb}@alibaba-inc.com\nAbstract\nDespite the recent progress in text summariza-\ntion made by large language models (LLMs),\nthey often generate summaries that are factu-\nally inconsistent with original articles, known\nas ""hallucinations"" in text generation. Un-\nlike previous small models (e.g., BART, T5),\ncurrent LLMs make fewer silly mistakes but\nmore sophisticated ones, such as imposing\ncause and effect, adding false details, over-\ngeneralizing, etc. These hallucinations are\nchallenging to detect through traditional meth-\nods, which poses great challenges for improv-\ning the factual consistency of text summariza-\ntion. In this paper, we propose an adversar-\nially DEcoupling method to disentangle the\nComprehension and Embellishme NTabilities\nof LLMs ( DECENT ). Furthermore, we adopt\na probing-based efficient training to cover the\nshortage of sensitivity for true and false in the\ntraining process of LLMs. In this way, LLMs\nare less confused about embellishing and un-\nderstanding; thus, they can execute the instruc-\ntions more accurately and have enhanced abili-\nties to distinguish hallucinations. Experimen-\ntal results show that DECENT significantly\nimproves the reliability of text summarization\nbased on LLMs.\n1 Introduction\nAlthough recent pre-trained language models have\nsignificantly boosted the performance of abstrac-\ntive summarization (Liu and Lapata, 2019; Lewis\net al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020), the hallucination\nproblem - that models usually generate summaries\nthat are factually inconsistent with the source text\n- remains difficult to resolve.

Still, it often hallucinates and embellishes the\nfacts, which means the model outputs fake content\nwithout supporting evidence in the original article.\nWorse still, the decoding process is usually affected\nby both abilities, making the summaries so full of\nhalf-truths that the hallucinations are much more\nhidden.\nEarly methods for improving factual consistency\nuse post-processing models (Dong et al., 2020),\nwhich correct summaries with hallucinations, but\nthey rely on external resources to obtain the error\ncorrection capability. Liu et al. (2023) introduces\nhuman revisions to achieve better performance, but\ndata collection is still difficult and costly. Besides,\nthese two-stage methods have a complicated struc-\nture, consisting of summary generation and cor-\nrection models. Considering that, some studies\ntry to solve hallucinations holistically during the\npre-training stage (Zhang et al., 2020; Wan and\nBansal, 2022). They design a new pre-training\nobjective with sentence selection strategies, encour-\naging the model to generate a faithful summary.\nHowever, pre-training requires enormous compu-\ntational resources, especially for large language\nmodels (LLMs).\nMoreover, some methods adopt contrastive learn-arXiv:2310.19347v3  [cs.CL]  14 Nov 2023', 'ing (Cao and Wang, 2021) in fine-tuning to teach\nthe model to distinguish between true and false\nmore clearly. To construct negative samples, they\nmodify the references by entity swapping and\nmasking-and-filling. Unfortunately, these auto-\ngenerated negative samples are inconsistent with\nthe distribution of errors made by LLMs in real sce-\nnarios. Zhang et al. (2023) point that instruction-\ntuned models have much stronger summarization\nabilities than previous fine-tuned ones. Current\nLLMs make fewer silly mistakes (e.g., entity con-\nfusion, irrelevant information generation) but more\nsophisticated ones (Pu et al., 2023). For example,\nthey fill in the details related to but not directly sup-\nported by the source text. Sometimes, they rewrite\noriginal sentences by imposing cause and effect\nor taking speculation as fact. These mistakes are\ndifficult to mimic by traditional perturbation-based\napproaches (Gekhman et al., 2023).\nWith the rapid development of LLMs, de-\nsigning prompts based on the chain of thoughts\n(COT) (Zhao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023) at-\ntracts scholarly attention. The models are posed\nwith several questions about the critical content in\nthe source text before final summarization, serving\nas contextual clues to guide models to generate fac-\ntually consistent summaries. Nevertheless, these\nmethods are sensitive to the domain because they\ndo not fundamentally improve the LLMs’ relia-\nbility. Inspired by preference optimization, many\nmethods use reinforcement learning with entail-\nment feedback (RLEF) to ameliorate hallucination\nproblems. For example, Roit et al. (2023) first\ntrain a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model\nfor consistency detection and then use it as the re-\nward model in reinforcement learning. Zablotskaia\net al. (2023) employ a similar mode to calibrate\ntowards consistency. However, it is challenging for\nhallucinations generated by LLMs to be detected\nthrough traditional methods (e.g. NLI paradigm,\nQA paradigm, etc.). Therefore, the performance\nof these reward models constrains the training of\nsummarization models. Otherwise, reinforcement\nlearning is usually unstable, and rewards are easily\nover-optimized (Rafailov et al., 2023; Chadi and\nMousannif, 2023). Asynchronous from the SFT\nstage, these methods (Schulman et al., 2017; Chen\net al., 2023b) require paired data with preference\nannotation and external training cost (Figure 2).\nIn summary, LLMs make more subtle mistakes\nthat are difficult to detect or reproduce, which ren-\nders previous methods invalid.

These problems motivated us to propose\nan adversarially DEcoupling method which disen-\ntangles the Comprehension and Embellishme NTof\nLLMs ( DECENT ) during the SFT stage to improve\nsummarization factual consistency with probing-\nbased efficient training.

"How does Flan-T5 perform vs. ChatGPT and fine-tuned models on TFSN and FPB, considering model size and shots?","['Conference acronym ’XX, November 27–29, 2018, Woodstock, NY Sorouralsadat Fatemi and Yuheng Hu\ncomparing the performance between Flan-T5-Base and Flan-T5-XL,\nthere is an increase of roughly 7% in performance.\nWhen comparing the zero-shot performance of Flan-T5 models\nto ChatGPT, ChatGPT appears to be less accurate despite having\nlarger parameters, which contradicts the zero-shot inference on the\nTFSN dataset. This discrepancy in performance can be explained by\nthe different language and jargon used in the FPB news headlines\nand the TFSN social media posts. ChatGPT, being trained on a large\ncorpus of social media posts, is better equipped to extract the true\nsentiment from social media text, which is reflected in its zero-shot\nperformance on the TFSN dataset. On the other hand, smaller LLMs\nlike Flan-T5 models outperform ChatGPT in the zero-shot setting\non the FPB dataset, possibly due to their large-scale instruction\ntuning, which enhances their reasoning capabilities and allows\nthem to extract sentiment from more complex texts.\nFew-shot Results. Results comparing few-shot prompting per-\nformance with zero-shot prompting performance are presented\nin Figure 2, Figure 3, and Table 3. Notably, we observe that 1-shot\nprompting can significantly improve the performance across almost\nall models and datasets, except for Flan-T5-Base (250M), where there\nis a slight decrease in performance. This decrease can be attributed\nto the impact of a single unrelated example, which can have an ad-\nverse effect on the smaller LLMs. Interestingly, we find that smaller\nLLMs (Flan-T5) benefit more on average from one demonstration\ncompared to ChatGPT.\nThe impact of increasing shots to 5 and 10 exhibited variability\nacross various models and datasets. On the TFSN dataset, it was ob-\nserved that a marginal improvement in performance was achieved\nfor both Flan-T5-Base and Flan-T5-Large models with an increase\nin the number of shots. However, the performance of Flan-T5-Large\nand Flan-T5-XL was impeded by the increase in shots. The varia-\ntion in outcomes can be ascribed to the difficulties associated with\nmanaging excessively lengthy contexts, which have the potential\nto lead the LLMs misguided, as revealed in a new study [27].\nThese findings are consistent with a previous study that high-\nlighted the sensitivity issue of LLMs when exposed to few-shot ex-\namples during inference [ 27]. In order to mitigate these disparities\nand obtain consistent enhancements in performance, it is impera-\ntive to employ more efficacious techniques for few-shot learning.\nFor example, a recent study suggested the retrieval of examples\nthat possess semantic similarity to a test query sample in order\nto generate its corresponding prompt [ 11]. Moreover, the intro-\nduction of the Chain of Thought (CoT) and Clue And Reasoning\nPrompting (CARP) methods aimed to improve the reasoning capa-\nbilities of LLMs. which could be beneficial for extracting sentiment\nfrom financial corpora [ 18,22]. Our future work will encompass an\nexploration of these approaches\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nIn this study, we extensively compared the performance of fine-\ntuned LLMs with different parameter sizes (ranging from 250M to\n3B) and their in-context learning capabilities, for financial sentiment\nanalysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned\nLLMs achieved comparable performance to state-of-the-art models\nwhile utilizing significantly fewer computational resources. The\nzero-shot and one-shot settings performed impressively, especiallyon the FPB dataset, which can be attributed to the corpus used for\npre-training the LLMs. Moreover, larger LLMs demonstrated better\nperformance in the zero-shot and one-shot settings.\nThe remarkable results obtained from fine-tuned, zero-shot, and\none-shot inferences of Flan-T5 models can be attributed to their\ninstruct fine-tuning. However, we observed inconsistent perfor-\nmance in the five-shot and ten-shot settings across all models and\ndatasets. Notably, increasing the number of shots did not lead to im-\nproved performance on average. Nevertheless, the models demon-\nstrated reasonable performance on both datasets and across all\nthree Flan-T5 models and ChatGPT, indicating their potential for\nfinancial sentiment analysis considering the scarcity of labeled data\nin finance-domain.\nIn conclusion, our study showcases the remarkable capabilities of\nLLMs, even smaller models, in both fine-tuning and in-context learn-\ning for financial sentiment analysis task. These findings provide\nvaluable insights into potential avenues for further investigation in\nthe field of financial sentiment analysis.\nFor future studies, we plan to assess the new methods of prompt\nformatting, such as CoT and CARP, and prompt selection by re-\ntrieving semantically-similar examples to the test queries, rather\nthan random sampling for few-shot settings [ 18,22]. The objective\nof this study is to determine the extent to which these methods\ncan consistently enhance the performance of LLMs in financial\nsentiment analysis tasks.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Tom Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, Melanie Subbiah, Jared D Kaplan,\nPrafulla Dhariwal, Arvind Neelakantan, Pranav Shyam, Girish Sastry, Amanda\nAskell, et al .2020.

Additionally, the results of the zero-shot\nand few-shot performance of Flan-T5 models are shown in Table 3.\nFine-tuned LLMs Results. As the results indicate in Figure 2\nand Table 2, on the TFSN dataset, the performance of fine-tuned\nFlan-T5 models is comparable to the state-of-the-art model, Instruct-\nFinGPT ,and significatly outperforms FinBert results. It is notewor-\nthy that we achieved this level of performance with significantly\nfewer computational resources (1 A100 GPU compared to 8 A100\nGPUs) and a comparable or even shorter training time by utilizing\nQLoRA method , especially for the Flan-T5-Base model (28 min-\nutes). These findings align with a previous study that highlights\nthe efficiency advantage of using Flan-T5 as a starting checkpoint\nfor further fine-tuning, as discussed in section 3.2.Zero-shot Results. As shown in Figure 2, the zero-shot learn-\ning results of Flan-T5 models (Base, Largr, and XL) on the TFSN\ndataset fall significantly behind those of all fine-tuned models (Fin-\nBert, Instruct-FinGPT, and all fine-tuned Flan-T5 models). Notably,\nInstruct-FinGPT and fine-tuned Flan-T5 models outperform LLMs\nby a clear margin of roughly 20%. However, the zero-shot per-\nformance of ChatGPT reaches 82%, surpassing the FinBert model\nbut still remaining inferior to Instruct-FinGPT and all fine-tuned\nFlan-T5 models.\nAs depicted in Figure 3 and Table 3, the zero-shot results of all\nFlan-T5 models on the FPB dataset show more promising outcomes,\neven performing comparably to the corresponding fine-tuned Flan-\nT5 models. This observation aligns with previous research findings\n[27]. Additionally, a noteworthy finding on the FPB dataset is that\nlarger models, with a greater number of parameters, tend to outper-\nform the smaller ones in zero-shot inference.

However, while LoRA\nstacks adapters over layers of LLMs, SSNA learns adapters\nseparate from LLMs and employs a GRU network for the\nintegration. Previous work (He et al. 2016) shows that gradi-\nent propagation across deep networks could be challenging.\nConsequently, compared to LoRA , the shallow architecture\ninSSNA could facilitate gradient-based optimization, lead-\ning to better performance. In addition, while LoRA adapts\nall the layers in LLMs, SSNA focuses on adapting only the\ntop-alayers. As will be shown in Figure 3, we empirically\nfind that adapting all the layers of LLMs may degrade the\nrecommendation performance.\nComparing SSNA toTMLP andTMoE Table 5 also shows\nthat compared to the state-of-the-art TTmethod TMLP and\nTMoE ,SSNA achieves significant average improvement over\nthe five datasets with the three LLMs. For example, with\nDistilBERT , in terms of R@10,SSNA outperforms both\nTMLP andTMoE on all the five datasets, and achieves a signif-\nicant average improvement of 8.0% and 7.3% over TMLP and\nTMoE , respectively.

Since all the source code\nfiles we employ only come with a maximum of a few tens of\nlines of concise comments and the description labels attached\n(if there are any) are also succinct, we can not rely on directly\napplying certain quantitative metrics (e.g., n-gram [23]) to\ndetermine the correctness of generated analysis results, which\nnecessitates a manual validation process.\nGround Truth. We choose to first manually examine the\noutcomes of GPT-4 [73], since it has better natural language\ngeneration and deduction capability. During this manual vali-\ndation process, four graduate/PhD-level students majoring in\ncomputer science or electrical engineering, each with over 5\nyears of programming experience, read the code and assess\nGPT-4’s generated explanation for accuracy and potential er-\nrors. The generated explanation for each code file is labeled\n‘correct’ if the functionality of the code and the description\nmatch. Cross-checking is conducted among the students to\nminimize biases. After this step, we consider those descrip-\ntions marked ‘correct’ as the ground truth and use those de-\nscriptions for further comparison among different LLMs.\nComparison Metrics. When evaluating the generated ex-planation (either non-obfuscated or obfuscated), we utilize\nthe following metrics:\n1.Cosine similarity (ranging from 0-1), since it is widely\nused in natural language processing-related tasks and\ncan serve as a coarse grain metric in this study;\n2.A Bert-based semantic similarity score [6] (ranging from\n0to5) that is more advanced in comparing the similarity\nof natural language inputs;\n3.ChatGPT-based evaluation [24, 31, 88, 92] ( True or\nFalse ).

Output should be ""Yes"" if\nsimilar, or ""No"" otherwise, followed by a brief jus-\ntification of how this is determined. ”\nWe then use the generated output to examine the correct-\nness of each model.\n4 Results\nIn this part, we present our results on our non-obfuscated code\ndataset and obfuscated code dataset, mainly to answer the two\nresearch questions raised in Section 1:\n•RQ1 : Do LLMs understand source code? (Section 4.1)\n•RQ2 : Can LLMs comprehend obfuscated code? (Sec-\ntion 4.2)', '3.3 Non-Obfuscated Code Dataset\nIn this study, we aim to systematically evaluate the ability of\nLLMs to analyze, comprehend, and summarize code. We first\nconstruct a non-obfuscated source code dataset. Three lan-\nguages are selected in this phase of study: JavaScript, Python,\nand C. We select JavaScript and Python since they are ranked\nthe top 2most used languages on Github [40] and we use\nthem as the representatives of scripting languages. We select\nC as it is also ranked high (#9) and it can be the representative\nof lower-level programming languages. All three languages\nwe select are widely deployed over the Internet and in various\ncomputing systems.\nFor JavaScript, we employ the combination of:\n•The Octane 2.0 benchmark [13], which is a JavaScript\nbenchmark to test JavaScript performance. It contains\nbenchmarks to test typical functionalities of JavaScript\nusers.\n•A list of practical JavaScript applications [7], including\npassword generator, etc.\nFor Python, we use the Python branch of the CodeSearch-\nNet dataset [46] provided by Google. It contains samples of\nPython projects crawled from the Internet.\nFor C, we utilize the combination of:\n•A list of classic performance benchmarks, including\nCoreMark [36], Dhrystone [82], Hint Benchmark [42],\nLinpack [35], NBench [67], Stream Benchmark [56],\nTripForce [5] and Whetstone [34].\n•A subset of the POJ-104 dataset [9, 59], which consists\nof C code samples to solve 104different programming\nproblems in an OJ system. The POJ-104 dataset pro-\nvides multiple different solutions for each programming\nproblem. In this study, for each programming problem,\nwe randomly select one file from the POJ-104 dataset to\nform the dataset used in this work.\nFor each code file in our dataset, we develop scripts to\nautomatically remove comments to eliminate their impacts\non analysis results. Our goal is to let LLMs focus on code,\nwithout providing unnecessary natural language hints in code\ncomments.\nThe histograms regarding the line of code (LoC) distribu-\ntions of processed files are shown in Figure 1. We can see\nthat our dataset includes code samples spanning from very\nshort (only a few lines) to very large-scale (over 10k lines).\nBesides, the code samples in our dataset are from different\nsources covering different use cases. We believe the coverage\nof this dataset is sufficient, since we have chosen the most\npopular programming languages and selected a diverse set of\ncode samples of different scales from different application\nscenarios.3.4 Obfuscated Code Dataset\nWe choose to perform obfuscation on the JavaScript branch of\nour non-obfuscated code dataset. This choice was driven by\nthe prevalence of code obfuscation practices in the JavaScript\nlanguage, since JavaScript code is usually visible to web users,\nmaking additional obfuscation protection necessary. Besides,\nmalicious JavaScript developers also apply obfuscation tech-\nniques to their code to hide the actual intent of their scripts.\nWe use: ( 1) an open-source tool called JavaScript Obfusca-\ntor [12] to generate the obfuscation version of our JavaScript\ncode; ( 2) Wobfuscator [70], a state-of-the-art obfuscator that\ntransforms part of the code to WebAssembly [43]. The tested\nobfuscation methods are listed below:\n1.Default obfuscation (DE), which replaces identifier\nnames with meaningless randomly generated strings,\nsimplifies source code to reduce readability, placing\nstrings in separate arrays, etc. [12]\n2.Dead code injection (DCI), which inserts random unre-\nlated code blocks to the source code [32] in addition to\nthe default scheme.\n3.Control flow flattening (CFF), which transforms the\nstructure of a program and hides control flow informa-\ntion [51] in addition to the default scheme.\n4.Split string (SS), which splits long strings into shorter\nchunks in addition to the default scheme to alleviate\ninformation leakage from embedded texts [86].\n5.Wobfuscator (WSM) [70], which performs cross-\nlanguage obfuscation to the provided code.\nOur chosen obfuscation methods cover classic code obfusca-\ntion techniques (the first 4) and a more recently developed\nobfuscation tool (Wobfuscator). By testing the performance\nof LLMs on these obfuscated code samples, we will be able\nto understand how these obfuscation techniques impact the\nability of LLMs to understand code.\nBesides obfuscating our previously acquired source code,\nwe also combine existing obfuscated code from online re-\nsources. We integrate winner code samples from the Interna-\ntional Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) [11], which is a\ncontest that challenges participants to write the most obscure\nand confusing C code. Instead of asking LLMs to explain\nthe code, we consider adding an extra challenge to generate\nde-obfuscated code and see if the generated code can be com-\npiled and run. Experiments on this part of our obfuscated code\ndataset evaluate the performance of LLMs when facing more\nflexible and non-standard obfuscation techniques.\n3.5 Measurement Method\nAfter collecting the response of code analysis from our target\nLLMs, we start a manual validation process to check the']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '2310.12357v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.12357v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 752477, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2310.12357v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.12357v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 752477, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
"How does VTimeLLM's 3-stage training boost its creative, fine-grained, and video reasoning skills vs. other Video LLMs?","[""A. More Examples\nWe showcase additional examples of video dialogues across\nvarious tasks, encompassing a creative task (Figure 4), a\nfine-grained understanding task (Figure 5), and a video rea-\nsoning task (Figure 6). In the creative task (Figure 4), our\nVTimeLLM demonstrates a remarkable capacity to compre-\nhend visual information and subsequently craft a poem in-\nspired by it. This achievement is attributed to we freeze\nthe LLM at all three stages of training, thereby preserv-\ning its ability for engaging in creative dialogue. In the\nfine-grained understanding task (Figure 5), our VTimeLLM\ncomprehends multiple events within the video, as well as\nthe specific visual content within individual events. This\ndemonstration underscores its proficiency in grasping tem-\nporal and spatial details, a capability attributed to our three-\nstage training strategy. In the video reasoning task (Figure\n6), our VTimeLLM responds to several questions requiring\ninference, showing its capacity to engage in reasoning based\non a comprehensive understanding of visual content.\nB. Templates and Prompts\nIn Stage 2, we need to transform events {si, ei, Ti}into\ntemplate-based QA, where siandeirepresent the start and\nend timestamps of a segment, ranging from 00 to 99. Ti\ncorresponds to its textual description. For a given sequence\nof events, there is a 20% probability of transformation into\nsingle-turn QA, completing a dense caption task where all\nevents are described within a single answer. Conversely,\nthere is an 80% probability of transformation into Multi-\nturn QA. In this scenario, each event is individually queried\nand answered within a dialogue, in the form of two tasks,\nevent captioning or temporal grounding. We provide 10\ntemplates for each task, as shown in Box 3.\nIn Stage 3, we need to transform events into high-quality\ndialogue. This is accomplished by providing a prompt to\na text-based LLM(Vicuna-7B v1.5). The prompt can be\nfound in Box 4. In the prompt, specific timestamps are\nnot provided because their inclusion does not enhance the\nLLM’s comprehension of temporal relationships. On the\ncontrary, they may introduce errors into the dialogue. Con-\nsequently, events are presented in a sequential order, ac-\ncompanied by specific symbols e.g., <s1>,<e1>in the\nbox, denoting the timestamps. The generated dialogue is\nexpected to integrate temporal perception and reasoning.\nC. Evaluation Process\nIn this section, we provide a detailed process on the evalu-\nation of temporal grounding and dense captioning tasks for\nVTimeLLM and other Video LLMs.\nIn the video, a man is standing in a yard and using an ax to cut a log. He \nis wearing a blue shirt and jeans and is holding the ax in his right hand.What is happening in the video?\nSure, here's a short poem inspired by the video:\nA man in blue, a yard to clear,\nAn ax in hand, a log to rear.\nHe swings with might, with each strike,\nThe log splits, a satisfying sight.\nCan you write a short poem inspired from the video?\nFigure 4.

The background of the video is not specified, but \nit is clear that the woman is performing in a professional setting.

Evaluation of VTimeLLM\nFor VTimeLLM that has undergone only stages 1, 2 train-\ning without stage 3, the input and output formats remain\nentirely consistent with the template. Consequently, we can\ndirectly employ the templates in Box 3 as queries. Specif-\nically, for the dense captioning task, we employ QD1, i.e.,\n1"", 'In the second stage, we then design the single-turn and\nmulti-turn related question answering (QA) tasks to en-\ndue VTimeLLM with the awareness of time boundaries and\nthe ability to understand the corresponding events bounded\nwithin the boundaries. We employ a large-scale video-text\ndataset containing multiple segments together with their\nroughly annotated labels for training VTimeLLM with the\nQA tasks. Finally, in the third stage, we further cre-\nate a high-quality dialogue dataset for instruction tuning,\nwhich simultaneously aligns VTimeLLM with human in-\ntention and enables VTimeLLM to conduct temporal under-\nstanding for video segments more precisely. Extensive ex-\nperiments show that VTimeLLM significantly outperforms\nexisting Video LLMs in time-related video understanding\ntasks, such as Temporal Video Grounding and Dense Video\nCaptioning. In addition, benefiting from the fine-grained\ntemporal understanding of videos, VTimeLLM is able to\nbeat existing Video LLMs in video dialogue benchmark,\ndemonstrating its superiority in cross-modal understanding\nand reasoning for videos. Our contributions in this paper\nare listed as follows,\n• We propose VTimeLLM, the first boundary-aware Video\nLLM, to the best of our knowledge.\n• We propose the boundary-aware three-stage training strat-\negy, which consecutively leverages i) large-scale image-\ntext data for feature alignment, ii) large-scale multi-event\nvideo-text data together with the temporal-related single-\nturn and multi-turn QA to enhance the awareness of time\nboundary, and iii) instruction tuning on the high-quality\ndialog dataset for better temporal reasoning ability.\n• We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that\nthe proposed VTimeLLM significantly outperforms exist-\ning Video LLMs in various fine-grained temporal-related\nvideo tasks, showing its superior ability for video under-\nstanding and reasoning.\n2. Related Works\n2.1. Multimodal Large Language Model\nImage LLMs To enable Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto comprehend visual information, significant efforts have\nbeen made to align visual and linguistic modalities. BLIP-\n2 [14] introduced the concept of Q-Former, utilizing learn-\nable query vectors to extract visual features from frozen\nimage encoders. MiniGPT-4 [37] demonstrated that fur-\nther fine-tuning with detailed image descriptions signifi-\ncantly enhances its usability. LLA V A [16] explored diverse\nmulti-modal instruction-following data, including conver-\nsations, detailed descriptions, and complex reasoning, aim-\ning to construct a general-purpose visual assistant. Recent\nendeavors, such as Kosmos-2 [21] and VisionLLM [26],\ndelved into more detailed aspects of image comprehension,\nincluding referring and grounding, significantly enhancingthe capability to describe intricate image details.\nVideo LLMs Driven by the success of Image LLM, re-\nsearchers have naturally extended their focus from single-\nframe images to multi-frame videos, leading to the emer-\ngence of Video-compatible LLMs like VideoChat [15],\nVideo-LLaMA [34], and Video-ChatGPT [20]. These mod-\nels employ a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage,\nlarge-scale datasets align video features with the feature\nspace of LLMs. In the second stage, a limited amount of\nGPT-annotated or human-annotated datasets are used for\ninstruction tuning. While these models exhibit impressive\noverall video comprehension, their abilities to describe spe-\ncific video segments and perform temporal reasoning re-\nmain limited. The limitation arises mainly due to the na-\nture of datasets used in the first training stage, such as Web-\nVid [2], which usually consist of one-event videos and noisy\ntextual annotations. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality,\ntemporally annotated data in the second stage poses a chal-\nlenge for models to conduct temporal reasoning. To bridge\nthis gap, our approach, VTimeLLM, introduces a bound-\nary perception stage between these two stages. This stage\nenables the model to precisely locate events within videos\nand describe multiple distinct events accurately, empower-\ning our model to grasp fine-grained details of video mo-\nments.\n2.2. Fine-Grained Video Understanding\nFine-grained video understanding, the ability to precisely\nlocate and comprehend specific events within a video, is\na crucial challenge for video analysis. When integrated\nwith natural language, there are two primary tasks: Tem-\nporal Video Grounding [1, 8] and Dense Video Caption-\ning [12, 25].\nTemporal Video Grounding Temporal Video Grounding\naims to identify corresponding video segments for given\ntextual inputs. Traditional approaches can be categorized\ninto two types: proposal-based [4, 29, 32] and proposal-\nfree methods [9, 30, 33]. Proposal-based techniques gener-\nate candidate proposals before ranking them based on rel-\nevance. In contrast, proposal-free methods directly predict\nthe start and end boundaries of the target moment.\nDense Video Captioning Dense Video Captioning is a\nmore intricate task, demanding both temporal localization\nand captioning for all events within an untrimmed video.\nEarlier methods [6, 11, 12] employed a two-stage process\ninvolving temporal localization followed by event caption-\ning. Recent developments [25, 28, 36] in this field have\nwitnessed a shift towards joint training of captioning and\nlocalization modules.

How can LLMs help with naming functions and explaining code?,"['3.4 Suggestion of variable and function names\nProper naming of functions and variables is critical for cod e readability and maintainability.\nDescriptive and self-explanatory names help to reduce the c ognitive load of understanding\ncode and eliminate the need for extensive comments. However , ﬁnding good names can be\nchallenging for programmers who would rather focus on code i mplementation than name\nselection. In this exercise, we explore whether an LLM can he lp generate suitable names\nfor functions and variables based on the code body.\nTo illustrate the process, we use the kernel_loop() function as an example (Lucchetti\nand Valentini, 2023). We start by opening a new session to clear the LLM’s memory a nd\nrename the function to foo() to avoid giving too much away about its purpose. The prompt\nis presented in Listing 15, and the output is displayed in Listing 16. The LLM provides\nsuggestions for function names along with a brief explanati on of their meanings.\nListing 15: Prompt to suggest function names for function foo()\nSuggest three descriptive function names for the following gretl function.

However, the second suggestion, local_linear_regression , may be ambiguous as\nto what ""local"" entails. Regarding the third suggestion, th e naming of ""h"" is not precise\nenough to be informative. Additionally, the suggested name ""estimation_regression"" is too\ngeneral and fails to specify the regression type.\nOverall, this exercise shows that an LLM could provide valua ble insights into suitable\nfunction and variable names, thus enhancing code readabili ty and maintainability for pro-\ngrammers.\nListing 16: List of suggested function names for function foo()\nHere are three possible descriptive function names for the p rovided gretl function:\n1. ""kernel_regression"": This name reflects the fact that th e function is performing a\n15', 'zeros(steps) , instead of being initialized as a type series. Once these mi nor corrections\nhave been made, the proposed code can be executed in gretl to r eturn accurate results.\nOur docstring-to-code exercises demonstrate that LLMs can provide signiﬁcant support\nfor generating gretl code. Speciﬁcally, they can serve at th e very least as a starting point\nby providing the general structure of a program. However, as expected, LLMs may not be\nfully aware of gretl functions, datatypes, and syntax, so th eir generated code may not be\nfully functional or may require further editing. Nonethele ss, the ability of LLMs to generate\naccurate and helpful code to some extent highlights their po tential as a valuable tool for de-\nvelopers and researchers in the ﬁeld of programming. Also, i t substantially lowers the entry\nbarrier as the level of basic programming skills required de crease (low-level programming).\n3.3 Code explanation and summarization\nResearch into using LLMs for summarizing code is currently a ctive (Ahmed and Devanbu,\n2022a). Programmers may encounter functions that are diﬃcult to u nderstand due to poor\ndocumentation, convoluted programming, or specialized ma thematical concepts that require\ndomain knowledge. Recent studies by Tian et al. ( 2023) have evaluated ChatGPT and found\nthat it can produce useful explanations of code to a high degr ee. The authors note that\neven for incorrect code, ChatGPT can reason the intended pur pose of the code, although\nits explanation may not accurately describe the current cod e.\nTo study the complexity of the kernel_loop() function (Lucchetti and Valentini, 2023),\nwe chose to use it as an example.

I NTRODUCTION\nTHE development of LLMs for embodied intelligence is\na rapidly evolving field with significant potential for\nadvancing both natural language processing and machine\nlearning. Notably, LLMs have already achieved remarkable\nsuccesses in Few-Shot Planning, enabling effective planning\nand decision-making for new tasks with minimal or no sam-\nple data. However, alongside these achievements, numerous\ntechnical and theoretical challenges persist. These include the\nintegration of text, images, and other sensor data simulta-\nneously, the reduction of latency for real-time applications,\nand the enhancement of training efficiency without sacrificing\nperformance.\nTo address these challenges, researchers employ a diverse\narray of methods such as machine learning [25], reinforcement\nlearning(RL) [20], and evolutionary algorithms [34]. These\nJinzhou Lin and Han Gao are co-first authors.\nRongtao Xu and Shibiao Xu are the corresponding authors (xurong-\ntao2019@ia.ac.cn; shibiaoxu@bupt.edu.cn).\nJinzhou Lin, Han Gao, Man zhang, Li Guo and Shibiao Xu are with School\nof Artificial Intelligence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,\nChina.\nXuxiang Feng is with the Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chi-\nnese Academy of Science.\nRongtao Xu and Changwei Wang are with the State Key Laboratory of\nMultimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences, China.methodologies are aimed at developing agents that are capable\nof learning from experience and continually improving their\nperformance over time. Concurrently, the application of LLM-\nbased agents in dataset investigations has garnered consider-\nable attention in recent years. Such intelligent agents utilize\nmachine learning models to analyze and derive insights from\nlarge-scale datasets, thereby making significant contributions\nto various domains including data mining, natural language\nprocessing, and information retrieval.\nIn this paper, we review existing studies that have employed\nLLM-based agents for dataset investigations. These studies\nhave demonstrated the efficacy of LLM-based agents in tasks\nlike sentiment analysis, topic detection, and entity recognition.\nThe success of these studies underscores the utility of LLM-\nbased agents as invaluable tools for data analysis and knowl-\nedge extraction. Datasets like MP3D [9], TOUCHDOWN [11],\nR2R [2], CVDN [70], REVERIE [55], RXR [36], SOON [90],\nProcTHOR [18], R3ED [86], and X-Embodiment [16] offer\nunique opportunities for exploring the capabilities of LLMs in\nreal-world settings. These datasets feature complex and diverse\nlinguistic content and provide rich, authentic environmental\ninformation.\nFurthermore, we examine various techniques and algo-\nrithms employed in LLM-based agents, such as Long Short-\nTerm Memory (LSTM) [5], Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN), Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), and\nattention mechanisms. These methods enhance the agents’\ncapabilities to process complex datasets, resulting in more\naccurate and meaningful outcomes. For example, ESC [88]\nuses a pre-trained commonsense reasoning language model\nfor spatial and object reasoning and employs probabilistic soft\nlogic to model ”soft” commonsense constraints, thus aiding\ntraditional exploration methods in zero-shot decision-making.\nSayNav [60] leverages commonsense knowledge stored in\nLLMs for versatile navigation solutions. By constructing a\n3D scene graph, generating high-level navigation plans, and\nexecuting short-distance point-goal navigation tasks, SayNav\nenables efficient and flexible navigation in unfamiliar or in-\ntricate environments. By understanding these benchmarks in-\ndepth, w e offer comprehensive knowledge and resources for\nresearchers and practitioners.\nIn summary, this paper serves as a valuable resource for\nboth researchers and practitioners in the field of embodied\nintelligence. It offers a comprehensive review of recent ad-\nvancements in research.

Additional methods\nlike ESC, NavGPT, and VELMA also exhibited superior\nnavigation planning and scene comprehension abilities. These\nexperimental findings underscore the pivotal role of LLMs in\nzero-shot navigation tasks.\nThe paper also outlines challenges and limitations inherent\nto LLMs in the realm of embodied intelligence. These include\nthe absence of a direct linkage between LLMs and the physical\nworld, the necessity for extensive training data, and the com-\nplexity of understanding and generating natural language in a\ndiverse array of contexts. Notwithstanding these impediments,\nseveral promising research trajectories exist that could propel\nadvancements in embodied intelligence. These encompass the\nformulation of more robust and adaptable language models,\nthe investigation of innovative training methodologies and ar-\nchitectures, the establishment of standardized benchmarks and\nevaluation metrics, and the critical need for cross-disciplinary\ncollaboration among researchers in AI, robotics, and social\nsciences.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Michael Ahn, Anthony Brohan, Noah Brown, Yevgen Chebotar, Omar\nCortes, Byron David, Chelsea Finn, Chuyuan Fu, Keerthana Gopalakr-\nishnan, Karol Hausman, Alex Herzog, Daniel Ho, Jasmine Hsu, Julian\nIbarz, Brian Ichter, Alex Irpan, Eric Jang, Rosario Jauregui Ruano, Kyle\nJeffrey, Sally Jesmonth, Nikhil J Joshi, Ryan Julian, Dmitry Kalashnikov,\nYuheng Kuang, Kuang-Huei Lee, Sergey Levine, Yao Lu, Linda Luu,\nCarolina Parada, Peter Pastor, Jornell Quiambao, Kanishka Rao, Jarek\nRettinghouse, Diego Reyes, Pierre Sermanet, Nicolas Sievers, Clayton\nTan, Alexander Toshev, Vincent Vanhoucke, Fei Xia, Ted Xiao, Peng\nXu, Sichun Xu, Mengyuan Yan, and Andy Zeng.

"How does FACTOOL use GPT-4 to evaluate chatbot reliability, and what does it mean for models like Vicuna-13B in complex cases?","['Survey on Factuality in Large Language Models 19\nFACTOOL [ 32] is a tool designed to function as a factuality detector, with the primary purpose of\nauditing generative chatbots and assessing the reliability of their outputs. This tool is employed to\nevaluate several contemporary chatbots, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, Bard [ 85], and Vicuna\n[33]. Notably, FACTOOL itself leverages the capabilities of GPT-4. For the evaluation process, the\nresearchers have curated a diverse set of prompts: 30 from knowledge-based question answering\n(KB-QA), 10 each from code, math, and scientific domains. The KB-QA prompts were sourced from a\nprior study, code prompts were taken from HumanEval, math prompts from another distinct study,\nwhile the scientific prompts were crafted by the authors themselves. The evaluation metrics included\nboth claim-level and response-level accuracies for each chatbot. To offer a more comprehensive and\nequitable evaluation, a weighted claim-level accuracy is used. The weighting is determined based on\nthe proportion of prompts from each category. The findings are illuminating. GPT-4 emerge as the\ntop performer in terms of both weighted claim-level factual accuracy and response-level accuracy\namong all the chatbots assessed. Another intriguing observation is that chatbots that underwent\nsupervised fine-tuning, such as Vicuna-13B, exhibited commendable performance in standard\nscenarios like KB-QA. However, their performance dip in more intricate scenarios, including those\ninvolving math, code, and scientific queries.\nWang et al . [263] ask several LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4 [ 193], BingChat [ 177] to answer\nopen questions from NaturalQuestions [ 128] and TriviaQA [ 119]. They manually estimate the\naccuracy of those LLMs on open question answering, and find that though LLMs can achieve nice\nperformance but still far away from perfect. Besides, they evaluate whether the GPT-3.5 can assess\nthe correctness of LLM-generated responses, and find negative results, even if the golden answer is\nalso presented. Similarity, Fu et al . [70] ask LLMs, such as GPT-2 and GPT-4, to directly score the\nfactuality of a summary, and find no significant correlation between LLM’s factuality indicators\nand human evaluations.\nKadavath et al . [120] investigate whether language models can evaluate the accuracy of their\nown assertions and predict which questions they can answer correctly. It is found that larger models\nare well-calibrated on diverse multiple-choice and true/false questions if given in the appropriate\nformat. The approach to self-evaluation on open-ended tasks is to ask the models to initially suggest\nanswers, and then evaluate the probability (P[True]) that their answers are correct. This resulted\nin compelling performance, calibration, and scaling on a diverse range of tasks. Furthermore,\nself-evaluation performance improved when the models are allowed to consider many of their own\nsuggestions before predicting the validity of a specific one.\nYu et al . [293] explore whether the internal knowledge of LLMs can replace the retrieved docu-\nments on knowledge intensive tasks. They ask LLMs, such as InstructGPT [ 191], to directly generate\ncontexts given a question rather than retrieving from database. They find the generated documents\ncontain the golden answers more often than the top retrieved documents. Then they feed the\ngenerated docs and retrieved docs to the Fusion-in-Decoder model [ 109] for knowledge-intensive\ntasks such as Open-domain QA [ 128] and find the generated docs are more effective than the\nretrieved docs, suggesting that the LLMs contain enough knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.\nMenick et al . [175] propose a task named Self-supported QA to evaluate LLMs’ ability in also\nproducing citations when generating answers.

It is worth noting that LLM challenges are discussed\nin details in a work by Kaddour et al. [207].\nA. Smaller and more efficient Language Models\nThis is a survey on large language models, and there\nhas been an initial push towards ”larger is better” that has\nclearly been rewarded with ever larger models like GPT-\n4 getting better accuracy and performance in benchmarks.\nHowever, those large models are costly and inefficient in\nseveral dimensions (e.g. high latency). In response to all of\nthis, there is a current research trend to come up with Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) as a cost-effective alternative to\nLLMs, particularly when used on specific tasks that might not\nrequire the full generality of larger models. Prominent works\nin this direction include Phi-1 [208], Phi-1.5 [209], and Phi-2\nfrom Microsoft.\nMore generally, we should expect many research efforts in\nthis area of how to train smaller and more efficient models.\nTechniques such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT),\nteacher/student, and other forms of distillation – see section\nIII-I – will continue to be used to build a smaller model out\nof larger ones.\nB. New Post-attention Architectural Paradigms\nTransformer blocks have been a crucial and constant part of\nmost of current LLM frameworks, and it’s a big question mark\nhow much longer this architecture will be in vogue, and what\nwill be the next big architectural break-through in the field of\ndeep learning (and NLP). Since AlexNet in 2012, we have seen\nmany architectures go in and out of fashion, including LSTM,GRU, seq2seq, but Transformers have been the dominant\napproach since its inception. As described earlier, attention is\nthe main mechanism driving transformers. More recently, there\nhas been promising research in alternative approaches that are\nbeing labelled as post-attention.\nAn important class of such class of post-attention models\nare the so called State Space Models (SSMs). While the notion\nof State Space Models has a long history in machine learning,\nit should be noted that in the context of language models, SSM\nis usually used in reference to the newer Structure State Space\nModel architecture or S4 for short (see Gu et al. [29]). Some\nrecent models in this category are Mamba [30], Hyena [210],\nand Striped Hyena [211].\nWhile all of those models are very competitive in terms of\nperformance in leaderboards and efficiency, they also address\nan important challenge in more traditional attention-based\narchitectures: the lack of support for larger context windows .\nHaving a good answer to many prompts requires context.\nFor example, the response to ”Recommend some good movies\nfor me” requires a lot of context about ”me” as well as what\nmovies are available and which ones I have not watched.\nContext length is especially important for RAG, where large\nportions of text might be retrieved and injected into the prompt\nfor generation (see section IV-C.\nThe longer the context length, the more tokens we can\nsqueeze into the context. The more information the model has\naccess to, the better its response will be. But on the other\nhand, with very long context, it would be hard for the model\nto remember everything and efficiently process all the informa-\ntion. Attention-based models are highly inefficient for longer\ncontexts and that is why we should expect more research in\ndifferent mechanisms that enable processing longer contexts\nand generally come up with more efficient architectures.\nThat being said, new architectures might not only propose']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '35', 'file_name': '2402.06196v2.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.06196v2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4871171, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

As shown in Fig. 21, both works simply represent\nthe input graph as a linear traversal and find that such\na naive approach successfully outperforms many existing\nstate-of-the-art KG-to-text generation systems. Interestingly,\nRibeiro et al. [167] also find that continue pre-training could\nfurther improve model performance. However, these meth-\nods are unable to explicitly incorporate rich graph semantics\nin KGs. To enhance LLMs with KG structure information,\nJointGT [42] proposes to inject KG structure-preserving\nrepresentations into the Seq2Seq large language models.\nGiven input sub-KGs and corresponding text, JointGT first\nrepresents the KG entities and their relations as a sequence\nof tokens, then concatenate them with the textual tokens\nwhich are fed into LLM. After the standard self-attention\nmodule, JointGT then uses a pooling layer to obtain the\ncontextual semantic representations of knowledge entities\nand relations. Finally, these pooled KG representations are\nthen aggregated in another structure-aware self-attention\nlayer. JointGT also deploys additional pre-training objec-\ntives, including KG and text reconstruction tasks given\nmasked inputs, to improve the alignment between text and\ngraph information. Li et al. [168] focus on the few-shot\nscenario. It first employs a novel breadth-first search (BFS)\nstrategy to better traverse the input KG structure and feed\nthe enhanced linearized graph representations into LLMs\nfor high-quality generated outputs, then aligns the GCN-\nbased and LLM-based KG entity representation. Colas et\nal. [169] first transform the graph into its appropriate repre-\nsentation before linearizing the graph. Next, each KG node\nis encoded via a global attention mechanism, followed by\na graph-aware attention module, ultimately being decoded\ninto a sequence of tokens. Different from these works, KG-\nBART [37] keeps the structure of KGs and leverages the\ngraph attention to aggregate the rich concept semantics in\nthe sub-KG, which enhances the model generalization on\nunseen concept sets.\n5.4.2 Constructing large weakly KG-text aligned Corpus\nAlthough LLMs have achieved remarkable empirical suc-\ncess, their unsupervised pre-training objectives are not nec-\nessarily aligned well with the task of KG-to-text genera-\ntion, motivating researchers to develop large-scale KG-text\naligned corpus. Jin et al. [170] propose a 1.3M unsupervised\nKG-to-graph training data from Wikipedia. Specifically, they\nfirst detect the entities appearing in the text via hyperlinks\nand named entity detectors, and then only add text that\nshares a common set of entities with the correspondingknowledge graph, similar to the idea of distance supervision\nin the relation extraction task [232]. They also provide a\n1,000+ human annotated KG-to-Text test data to verify the\neffectiveness of the pre-trained KG-to-Text models. Simi-\nlarly, Chen et al. [171] also propose a KG-grounded text\ncorpus collected from the English Wikidump. To ensure the\nconnection between KG and text, they only extract sentences\nwith at least two Wikipedia anchor links. Then, they use\nthe entities from those links to query their surrounding\nneighbors in WikiData and calculate the lexical overlapping\nbetween these neighbors and the original sentences. Finally,\nonly highly overlapped pairs are selected. The authors ex-\nplore both graph-based and sequence-based encoders and\nidentify their advantages in various different tasks and\nsettings.\n5.5 LLM-augmented KG Question Answering\nKnowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to find\nanswers to natural language questions based on the struc-\ntured facts stored in knowledge graphs [233], [234]. The\ninevitable challenge in KGQA is to retrieve related facts and\nextend the reasoning advantage of KGs to QA. Therefore,\nrecent studies adopt LLMs to bridge the gap between nat-\nural language questions and structured knowledge graphs\n[174], [175], [235]. The general framework of applying LLMs\nfor KGQA is illustrated in Fig. 22, where LLMs can be used\nas 1) entity/relation extractors, and 2) answer reasoners.\n5.5.1 LLMs as Entity/relation Extractors\nEntity/relation extractors are designed to identify entities\nand relationships mentioned in natural language questions\nand retrieve related facts in KGs. Given the proficiency in\nlanguage comprehension, LLMs can be effectively utilized\nfor this purpose. Lukovnikov et al. [172] are the first to uti-\nlize LLMs as classifiers for relation prediction, resulting in a\nnotable improvement in performance compared to shallow\nneural networks. Nan et al. [174] introduce two LLM-based\nKGQA frameworks that adopt LLMs to detect mentioned\nentities and relations. Then, they query the answer in KGs\nusing the extracted entity-relation pairs. QA-GNN [131]\nuses LLMs to encode the question and candidate answer\npairs, which are adopted to estimate the importance of\nrelative KG entities. The entities are retrieved to form a\nsubgraph, where an answer reasoning is conducted by a\ngraph neural network. Luo et al. [173] use LLMs to calculate\nthe similarities between relations and questions to retrieve\nrelated facts, formulated as\ns(r, q) =LLM(r)⊤LLM(q), (12)\nwhere qdenotes the question, rdenotes the relation, and\nLLM(·)would generate representation for qandr, respec-\ntively. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [236] propose a LLM-based\npath retriever to retrieve question-related relations hop-by-\nhop and construct several paths. The probability of each\npath can be calculated as\nP(p|q) =|p|Y\nt=1s(rt, q), (13)\nwhere pdenotes the path, and rtdenotes the relation at the\nt-th hop of p. The retrieved relations and paths can be used']","Graph linearization boosts KG-to-text systems by representing the input graph as a linear traversal, which has been found to outperform many existing state-of-the-art KG-to-text generation systems. However, its limitation is that it is unable to explicitly incorporate rich graph semantics in KGs.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '17', 'file_name': '2306.08302v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2306.08302v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 3347785, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

LLMs Selection.\nIn order to generate highly diverse solutions to the instruc-\ntions, we select a diverse pool of 14 LLMs spanning eight\nmodel families. These include GPT-4-Turbo and GPT-3.5-\nTurbo as closed-source LLMs. We include Llama-2-13B-Chat\nand Llama-2-70B-Chat [5], specialized for chat use cases. We\nchoose CodeLlama-7/13/34B-Instruct models [2], instruction-\ntuned for code generation. We also include WizardLM-15/33B\nmodels [43] and Mistral-7B-Instruct [4], which are instruction-\ntuned LLMs that can follow complex instructions. Finally,\nwe include WizardCoder-15/33B [37] and DeepSeek-Coder-\n6.7/33B-Instruct [3], which are instruction-tuned LLMs that\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on code generation\nbenchmarks such as HumanEval [1] and HumanEval+ [7].\nFrom this pool, we randomly select four LLMs for each in-\nstruction to generate responses, allowing for the representation\nof a variety of coding approaches and styles.\nD. Principle-Driven Code Generation.\nIn this step, we leverage the concept of principle-driven gen-\neration [41], [42], [44] for code. One principle, corresponding\nto the coding preference of the sample, is randomly chosen\nper LLM and appended to the instruction in an input prompt\nto guide the generation. This strategy helps the LLMs generate\nresponses that potentially align with the requirements of the\ncoding preferences. The output of this step is the four LLMs’\nresponses to the principle-augmented instructions.\nE. LLM-as-a-Judge Annotation.\nWe apply the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology [34] to annotate\nresponses using GPT-3.5-Turbo. Drawing from practices estab-\nlished in previous work [30], we implement a set of guidelinesTABLE II: Excerpt of ratings and rationales generated by\nGPT-3.5-Turbo using LLM-as-a-Judge prompting.

Additionally, the comments do not cover the relevance of\nternary search in algorithmic strategies, making it less accessible to users\nwith varying technical backgrounds.\nensuring GPT-3.5-Turbo delivers both consistent and objective\nfeedback. Each annotation consists of (1) a score on a 1–5\nscale offering a comprehensive assessment of the response’s\nalignment, and (2) a rationale for the assigned score , high-\nlighting the response’s strengths and identifying any potential\nshortcomings. Tasking GPT-3.5-Turbo to provide a rationale\nfor the scores encourages a chain-of-thought [45] process\nduring the annotation process, elucidating the reasons behind\nthe scores and meaningful feedback. In addition, this process\nmitigates the risk of variability and subjectivity that might arise\nfrom purely quantitative assessments. Consequently, this re-\nflective process guarantees that the scoring is not just a surface-\nlevel judgment but can be backed by thoughtful consideration\nof some well-defined coding preferences evaluation criteria.\nTable I illustrates the assessment template and evaluation\ncriteria for code readability evaluation. It aims to provide pre-\ncise and comprehensive criteria to the LLM judge for response\nassessment. We design analogous assessment templates, each\ntailored with specific evaluation criteria, for evaluating the\nother coding preferences. The annotation procedure entails\nconstructing a prompt combining the coding preference assess-\nment template and the four LLMs responses. GPT-3.5-Turbo is\nthen tasked to generate the annotations for all four responses\nsimultaneously, enhancing the consistency and reliability of\nthe evaluation process over individual response assessments.\nTable II presents an example of the output of the annotation', 'process using GPT-3.5-Turbo, with the LLMs responses and\nsome rationales omitted for brevity. This example showcases\nGPT-3.5-Turbo’s capability to provide comprehensive justifi-\ncations for each rating, demonstrating its effective evaluation\ncapabilities. Furthermore, Table II illustrates an example of\nrelatively intricate instructions included in CodeUltraFeed-\nback, showcasing the complexity of the task. More details\nabout CodeUltraFeedback and the prompt templates are in-\ncluded in our replication package: https://github.com/martin-\nwey/CodeUltraFeedback.\nIII. E VALUATING LLM S ON CODEULTRA FEEDBACK\nWhile CodeUltraFeedback has the potential to facilitate\ndiverse downstream applications, including LLM alignment\nthrough RLAIF and DPO, we begin our experiments by\nanalyzing the dataset itself. Specifically, the goal is to gauge\nGPT-3.5-Turbo’s judging capabilities and the innate ability\nof LLMs to align to coding preferences without any tailored\noptimization involved.\nA. LLMs Scores Exploration\nWe start by exploring the ratings generated by GPT-3.5-\nTurbo in the LLM-as-a-Judge annotation phase. In Table III,\nwe present a detailed analysis of the average scores across\ncoding preferences for each LLM, offering initial insight into\ntheir baseline capabilities.\nFirst, we observe that GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo\nscore the highest across all preferences and on average. This\nresult is expected considering both models have undergone\nextensive instruction and RLHF tunings, which help align the\nLLMs more closely with human preferences [33].\nAt first glance, the scores might suggest marginal score\ndiscrepancies given the 1–5 scoring range. However, these\nvariations are substantial and carry statistical significance. To\nquantify this significance, we performed pairwise Welch’s t-\ntests with 100,000 permutations to mitigate the risk of type\nI error. These t-tests compare the score distributions for each\nLLM (and GPT-4-Turbo) against GPT-3.5-Turbo across each\ncoding preference and consistently reveal highly significant\nstatistical differences (with p <0.0001 for most comparisons).\nTherefore, these results validate the discernible performance\ngaps between all models and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Moreover, the re-\nsults also demonstrate a notably superior performance of GPT-\n4-Turbo relative to GPT-3.5-Turbo. This effectively illustrates\nGPT-3.5-Turbo’s impartiality as a judge, rewarding higher\nscores to more proficient LLMs and equitably evaluating its\nown responses.\nIn summary, our findings indicate that all LLMs, including\nhighly capable ones such as WizardCoder-33B and DeepSeek-\nCoder-33B-Instruct, underperform compared to GPT-3.5-\nTurbo. This underperformance is likely due to a lack of\nalignment of the LLMs, and we believe fine-tuning them using\nalignment techniques might enhance their performance.\nB.

How do LLMs' strategic reasoning and NE convergence affect their optimal payoff in games?,"['Preview\nprompts, otherwise, it might be difficult to filter out if the action was chosen because one wants to\nwin at all cost, or one is simply being irrational.\nA.3.2 S TRATEGIC REASONING ABILITY\nIn competitive games, we can expect agents to be playing the NE strategies when there is common\nknowledge of rationality. However, when it is possible that opponents are not completely rational,\nthe rational strategy might not necessarily be the winning strategy. As a result, in order to gain the\nhighest payoff, a player would need to reason about the strategies of other players, which we defined\nto be their strategic reasoning ability. Given historical information, we expect that models who are\ncapable of strategic reasoning to show timely adaption to the strategies of other players to avoid loss\nor even increase payoff. The higher payoffs one is able to obtain over time, the better one is able to\nform correct beliefs about other players’ strategies, and thus the greater is one’s strategic reasoning\nability. We define a similar metric as the measure in 1\nri=1\nTPT\nt=1ρ(ˆait)\nρop(4)\nwhere ˆaitis the action chosen by agent iat time stamp t(with history given); ρ(ˆait)equals to payoff\nafter the action ˆait;ρoprefers to optimal payoff of the respective game; Tindicates the total time;\nrirefers to the ratio of average payoff of agent iover total time Tto the optimal payoff. The closer\nthe distance between the ratio and 1, the better the strategic reasoning ability.\nIn order to further distinguish the level of LLMs’ strategic reasoning ability, we vary the complete-\nness of historical information3mainly in two ways:\n1) Only the strategies of other players in the past games (applies to both game types)\n2) Provides the private information along with the strategies of other players in the past games\n(applies to the auction games)\nOur assumption is that the more information is revealed, the agent with stronger strategic reasoning\nability is more likely to win. Since the beauty contest game has a more simplified setting, it is\nanticipated that by showing the strategies of other players, it would be sufficient to distinguish the\nstronger player. Whereas for the auction games, they are more complex, thus more information\nmight be necessary for better identification, on the other hand, insufficient information may mislead\nLLMs to pursue wrong strategies.\nMoreover, we take irrational behaviours (i.e. overbids) as well as bad strategies (i.e. miscalculations)\ninto account and suggest that a model with good strategic reasoning ability may not obtain high\nexpected payoffs due to such factors. As a result, we also make use of self-competing games,\nand specifically inform LLMs that all the players are of similar level of rationality and strategic\nreasoning ability. By force of contrast, we could potentially deduce which models are the ones that\nshould have received higher payoffs when there are less unfavourable factors. Meanwhile, in self-\ncompeting beauty contest game, we can observe whether the curve of respective LLM’s strategies\nconverges to the NE in order to further verify their strategic reasoning ability.\n3The history is not necessarily in the same session of the games, details will be specified in the experimental\nsetting\n22', 'Preview\nFurthermore, while all models are able to complete the games in the English setting, PaLM2 and\nGPT3.5 ’s performance cannot be assessed in the Chinese setting.

As we reveal the game history to the LLMs, we are testing\ntheir ability to reason about the other players’ strategies. We measure the ability by looking at the\nfrequency of winning, and found that certain LLMs do win more often than the others, indicating\ndifferent strategic reasoning capability across the models and some displaying stronger reasoning\nability relative to the others.

"How do AI tools lead to plagiarism and cheating in computing education, and what detection challenges do educators face?","['2 Michael Sheinman Orenstrakh, Oscar Karnalim, Carlos Aníbal Suárez, and Michael Liut\nAlthough Artificial Intelligence (AI) can foster education [ 9], it might be misused to breach academic integrity.\nParaphrasing tools [ 40] and code obfuscation tools [ 2] for example, are misused to cover up evidence for plagiarism (a\nbreach of academic integrity about copying one’s work and reusing it without proper acknowledgment [14]).\nMisuse of AI chatbots with large language models (LLM) [ 6] such as ChatGPT1is another trending threat for\nbreaching academic integrity. Students can complete exams or assessments with limited effort, resulting in questionable\nperformance; it is unclear whether the learning objectives are actually met. The misuse can be considered as contract\ncheating (i.e., getting help in exchange for mutual incentives [ 27]) since AI chatbots provide responses in exchange for\nadditional user data. However, considering AI responses are generated based on other people’s textual data without\nproper acknowledgment, we believe it is more justifiable to consider the misuse as plagiarism.\nWhile checking student work for plagiarism, instructors are often aided by automated detectors. A number of\ndetectors have been developed to detect whether a work is a result of LLM. Two of them are GPT-2 Output Detector [ 50]\nand Giant Language model Test Room (GLTR) [ 16]. Nevertheless, due to the recency of misuse of AI chatbots, Computing\neducators might have limited information about publicly available detection detectors. Further, it is challenging to\nchoose the most suitable detector for their teaching environment. To the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical\nstudies comparing the detectors in terms of effectiveness.\nIn response to the aforementioned gaps, we investigate LLM-generated text detectors and formulate the following\nresearch question (RQ): “How effective are LLM-generated text detectors?”\nIt is clear that there is a need in the community to understand if the currently available detectors are able to detect\nLLM-generated content [37, 45, 52] and what there reliability is.\nAs an additional contribution, we also report our experience in using the LLM-generated text detectors. It might be\nuseful for readers interested in employing those detectors in their classrooms.\n2 RELATED WORK\nThis section discusses common breaches of academic integrity in computing education and misuse of AI to breach\nacademic integrity.\n2.1 Common Breaches of Academic Integrity\nAcademic integrity encourages students to act honestly, trustworthy, respectfully, and responsibly in learning2. Lancaster\n[25] lists five common breaches of academic integrity in computing education: plagiarism, collusion, contract cheating,\nexam cheating, and research fraud. It is important to inform students about instructors’ expectations about academic\nintegrity in their courses [49] and penalize those who breach academic integrity.\nPlagiarism happens when ideas, words, or even code is reused without proper acknowledgment and permission to\nthe original author(s) [ 14]. It is commonly identified with the help of automated detectors [ 3] such as Turnitin3, Lichen\n[38], MOSS4, and JPlag [ 39]. Any submissions with high similarity will be investigated and if they are indeed a result of\nmisconduct, the students will be penalized [20].\nNevertheless, identifying plagiarism is not always straightforward; some perpetrators disguise their act with auto-\nmated paraphrasing [ 23,40], essay spinning [ 26] or code obfuscation [ 2]. The automated detectors should be resilient to\ncommon disguising practices in addition to being effective and efficient.

LLM is derived from Language\nModel (LM), a statistical model at which each sequence of words are assigned with a probability [ 11]. Per query or\nquestion, the response is generated by concatenating sequences of words that have high probability with the query or\nthe question.\nChatGPT is a popular example of LLM. The tool is developed by OpenAI, a non-profit American research laboratory\non top of GPT-3, a LLM with deep learning to generate human-like text. The tool relies on reinforcement and supervised\nlearning to further tune the model.\nA number of automated detectors have been developed to help instructors identifying AI misuses for breaching\nacademic integrity. In the context of plagiarism and collusion, automated detectors nullify common alterations that can\nbe done without understanding the content [ 24,43] and remove contents that are not evident for raising suspicion [ 48].\nIn dealing with misuses of AI chatbots, a few automated detectors are developed under the same way as the chatbots\nvia pretrained model, but dedicated to detect AI-generated texts.

This results in a total of 1,312prediction results.\nOf the 164submissions, 134were written in English ( 20of which were generated by a LLM, and another 10which\nwere LLM-generated and paraphrased) and 20were written in Spanish ( 10of which were AI-generated). The submissions\nwere collected between 2016 and 2018 (prior to the release of ChatGPT), and were made in “databases”, “networking”,\nand a “final thesis project” course. These courses were specifically selected as they are upper-year computer science\nmajor courses that touch on a mix of systems and theory (databases and networking), as well as technical writing in\ncomputer science with a programming/development component (final thesis project). The students in these courses\nwere primarily in a computer science major. It should also be noted that Spanish was selected as an alternative language\nto analyse because it is one of the world’s most popular languages, and some of the authors have experience writing\nand evaluating technical material in this language.\nThe assessments analyzed in this study (see Table 1) are taken from three undergrad courses. The first course is a\ndatabases course offered to third-year computer science students in their first or second semester. It is a mix of database\ntheory and practical systems application. There are 101paper submissions from this course which involved a final\nassessment where students wrote a report analyzing two industry players and their use of databases and data centers,\nthis was written in English.\n10https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/26/tech/chatgpt-passes-exams/index.html\n11https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-students-could-use-ai-to-cheat-but-its-a-chance-to-rethink-assessment-altogether-198019\nManuscript submitted to ACM']","AI tools lead to plagiarism and cheating in computing education by allowing students to complete exams or assessments with limited effort, resulting in questionable performance and unclear learning objectives.

"How does JP Morgan's 'COiN' use AI for loan contract analysis, and what are the broader impacts on financial docs and customer service?","[""- 28 - is Mirae Asset Securities, which has introduced a service utilizing ChatGPT to summarize stock \nmarket conditions (Korea Financial Times, 2023).  \n4.2.2.  Automated Financial Document Processing  \nIn the domain of automated financial document processing, efficiency gains can be achieved \nthrough activities like contract analysis and assistance in financial report generation. Contract \nanalysis involves utilizing LLMs to automatically analyze and extra ct essential information from \nvarious contracts, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors in financial workflows. Additionally, \nLLMs can aid in financial report generation, summarizing information and assisting financial \nexperts in swiftly producing report s. Real -world examples include Samsung Life's automation of \ninsurance claims payment processes using AI -based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) \n(AITimes, 2023) and JP Morgan's 'COiN,' employing AI to analyze corporate loan contracts, \nclassify types, and extract key phrases, reducing analysis time and improving accuracy (Financial \nFocus, 2023).  \n4.2.3.  Financial Research and Information Extraction  \nIn the realm of financial research and information extraction, LLMs prove valuable in extracting \nuseful information from financial datasets for research purposes or recommending financial \nproducts aligned with customer investment preferences. LLMs efficiently extract information \nnecessary for financial res earch by collecting and synthesizing financial data from various sources, \nenabling financial experts to access the latest information for more effective decision -making. \nExamples include Korea Investment & Securities' AI -based research service, 'AIR Listin g Index \nFund (ETF),' and DB Insurance's use of AI to analyze relational data, detect insurance fraud, and \nimprove accuracy (Korea Financial Times, 2023; Data Hunt, 2023).  \n4.2.4.  Customer Interaction and Service Enhancement  \nIn the domain of customer interaction and service enhancement, automatic response systems and \npersonalized product recommendations contribute to increased customer satisfaction. Automatic \nresponse systems, powered by LLMs, efficiently address diverse custo mer inquiries, reducing \nresponse times and enhancing efficiency. LLMs can also analyze customer financial histories and \npreferences to recommend tailored financial products, increasing customer satisfaction and \nimproving service quality. Examples include K B Kookmin Card and KBpay's 'Event Q&AI' \nservice, providing marketing event information through natural language dialogue (AITimes, \n2023), Toss's 'Ask GPT' feature for conversational interactions in their app (AITimes, 2023), and "", ""- 29 - NongHyup Bank's 'ARMI AI,' utilizing AI chatbots for automating customer satisfaction surveys \nand extracting statistics and analysis results automatically (Financial Focus, 2023).  \nThese applications demonstrate that integrating LLMs into the financial domain automates \nvarious tasks, supports decision -making, and can provide a competitive edge for financial \ninstitutions, enhancing adaptability in the rapidly changing financial market . \n \n5. Discussion  and Conclusion  \nThis study has presented the fine -tuning of Language Models (LLMs) specialized in the financial \ndomain and explored various applications. By considering the characteristics of financial data, \nfine-tuning was conducted to enhance the model's performance. Th e study delved into applying \nLLMs to diverse tasks in finance, such as financial prediction, automation, research, and customer \ninteraction. Notably, the step -by-step validation results were provided for the procedures of \nfinancial domain dataset selection , data preprocessing, pre -trained LLM model selection, \nhyperparameter tuning, fine -tuning execution environment setup, evaluation metrics for fine -\ntuning performance, and model generation.  \nThe study highlighted considerations for fine -tuning in the financial domain, examining areas \nsuch as prediction accuracy improvement, workflow efficiency enhancement through automation, \nand the facilitation of research and customer service. In the context  of financial prediction, an \nenhanced prediction accuracy aids investors in making more precise decisions, while automation \ncontributes to efficiency gains, reducing processing times in tasks like contract analysis and \nfinancial report generation. Addition ally, LLMs can be instrumental in research, efficiently \nextracting information for research reports, thereby supporting decision -making and strategic \nplanning within financial institutions. Regarding customer interaction improvement, automated \nresponse sys tems and personalized product recommendations can enhance the quality of customer \nservice.  \nHowever, the study focuses primarily on the methodology of fine -tuning model creation, leading \nto certain limitations. The dataset's limited diversity may result in the model being overly biased \ntoward specific domains, necessitating a more extensive and r epresentative dataset. Additionally, \novercoming the model's generalization limitations may require further parameter tuning and \noptimization of the deep network structure.

"How do calibration sample counts affect Vicuna-7B's zero-shot performance with Wanda and SparseGPT in maintaining coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance in summarization?","['Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nerated by compressed LLMs wrt. GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) model based on varying metrics ( e.g.,\ncorrectness, helpfulness, logic, accuracy, etc.) on a scale of [0-10] with detailed explanations.\nDataset Details. We rely on the 80 high quality multi-turn questions identified in MT-Bench (Zheng\net al., 2023). This setting covers common-use human-centric interaction with LLMs, and focuses\non challenging questions to differentiate models. We used 8 common categories of user prompts to\nguide the prompt construction to interact with compressed LLMs: writing, roleplay, extraction, rea-\nsoning, math, coding, etc. For each category, we adopted manually designed 10 multi-turn questions\nfrom MT-Bench to evaluate our compressed models. Details can be found in Appendix A.4.\nResults and Analysis. Results are summarized in Figure 6. Our primary observations are: 1\nUnlike in-context text summarization, in this task setting, compressed LLMs have to access the\nknowledge to respond to conversations maintaining high helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and detail.\nWe again observe that compressed LLMs with various pruning methods are matching only up to\nsparsity ratio of ∼25%.2Surprisingly, in the matching regime, the simple baseline of one-shot\nmagnitude pruning performs comparable or slightly better than SoTA pruning methods. 3No\nmatching subnetwork can be identified for N:M sparsity. 4Interestingly, our average generated\nunique token analysis in Figure 6(c) illustrates that compressed LLMs lose the ability to generate\ndistinct unique content, instead, they can only produce more repetitive texts.\n4 A DDITIONAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nSmall-Dense vs. Large-Sparse: which is favorable? We attempt to understand an interesting\nquestion: if pruned LLMs with larger architecture (Large-Sparse) is better than smaller dense mod-\nels with similar parameter count (Small-Dense)? Pruning large LLMs doesn’t come for free, and it\nis important to investigate if the cost of pruning can be reflected in the performance benefit of Large-\nSparse models. To our surprise, in comparison with dense Vicuna-7B (MMLU accuracy 46.7%), we\nfound compressed Vicuna-13B with exactly similar parameter count (46.16% sparsity) of 7 billion\nusing one-shot magnitude, Wanda, SparseGPT can only achieve MMLU accuracy of 31.7%, 45.3%,\nand 46.3%, respectively. This is a clear indication that current sparsity algorithms are not yet up to a\nstage where the cost of pruning can be justified by performance benefits obtained from large-sparse\ncompressed models.\n1 8 16 32 64 128\nWikiText/uni00A0Caliberation/uni00A0Samples010203040Average/uni00A0Accuracy\nWanda/uni00A050%/uni00A0\nSparseGPT/uni00A050%/uni00A0\nWanda/uni00A070%/uni00A0\nSparseGPT/uni00A070%/uni00A0\nFigure 7: Zero-shot performance\nof 50% & 70% pruned Vicuna-7B\nwrt. calibration sample counts.How many calibration data samples are needed? We at-\ntempt to analyze how calibration dependent pruning methods\n(Wanda and SparseGPT) perform with varying amount of cali-\nbration samples. Figure 7 illustrates the zero-shot performance\nof 50% & 70% pruned Vicuna-7B using Wanda and SparseGPT\non knowledge-intensive MMLU benchmark. It is interesting to\nobserve that calibration sample count plays a vital role in pre-\nserving the performance of SparseGPT unlike Wanda. Note\nthat at high sparsity ratio (70%), Wanda cannot recover any\nperformance; SparseGPT surprisingly benefits noticeably from\ncalibration. This suggests that carefully selected calibration\nsamples can play a vital role in designing better pruning algo-\nrithms to compress LLMs even up to significantly high sparsity.\n5 C ONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS\nIn this paper, we propose to explore the effectiveness of SoTA compression methods beyond per-\nplexity to address the inability of perplexity to capture the subtle variations incurred during the\nderivation of compressed LLMs from their dense counterparts. Our work introduces Knowledge-\nIntensive Compressed LLM Benchmar K(LLM-KICK) to facilitate a fair and holistic evaluation by\nunveiling many merits and pitfalls of SoTA compression methods. Our study reveals that compres-\nsion significantly impacts the knowledge encoded in LLMs during pre-training, compressed LLMs\nperform quite well with knowledge augmented in-context settings. We primarily restrict our eval-\nuation to Vicuna (decoder-only architecture) due to its open-source license, high performance, and\ninstruction-following ability. For future work, we aim to investigate how the lost knowledge due to\ncompression can be recovered using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, e.g., LoRA (Hu et al.,\n2021) and QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023b).\n9', 'Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0GPT/uni00AD4/uni00A0%/uni00A0Score/uni00A0Drop/uni00A0[Magnitude]\nCoherence\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0\nConsistency\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0\nFluency\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0\nRelevance\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n8/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0GPT/uni00AD4/uni00A0%/uni00A0Score/uni00A0Drop/uni00A0[SparseGPT]\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\n0510152025303540455055606570\nSparsity/uni00A0Ratio30\n20\n10\n0\nSmall/uni00A0Story\nMid/uni00A0Story\nLarge/uni00A0Story\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Small]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Mid]\n4/uni00ADbit/uni00A0GPTQ/uni00A0[Large]\nSmall Mid Large0246810GPT/uni00AD4/uni00A0Judge/uni00A0ScoreDense/uni00ADSmall\nDense/uni00ADMid\nDense/uni00ADLargeMagnitude\nSparseGPT\nWanda\nSmall Mid Large0246810GPT/uni00AD4/uni00A0Judge/uni00A0ScoreDense/uni00ADSmall\nDense/uni00ADMid\nDense/uni00ADLargeMagnitude\nSparseGPT\nWanda\nSmall Mid Large0246810\nDense/uni00ADSmall\nDense/uni00ADMid\nDense/uni00ADLargeMagnitude\nSparseGPT\nWanda\nSmall Mid Large0246810\nDense/uni00ADSmall\nDense/uni00ADMid\nDense/uni00ADLargeMagnitude\nSparseGPT\nWanda\nFigure 5: Compressed LLMs for In-Context Summarization.

How do Deterministic LLMs use KG embeddings and entity masking to better capture factual knowledge in pre-training?,"['JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. ??, NO. ??, MONTH 20YY 8\nLLMs\nBob Dylan wrote blowin ... 1962Bob\nDylanBlowin’  in\nthe W ind\nInput T ext: Bob Dylan  wrote Blowin’  in the W ind in 1962...Text RepresentationsKnowledge Graph\nRepresentations\nText Sequence EntitiyText-knowledge\nAlignment\nFig. 9. Injecting KG information into LLMs training objective via text-\nknowledge alignment loss, where hdenotes the hidden representation\ngenerated by LLMs.\nsentiment words in the word masking objective.\nThe other line of work explicitly leverages the connec-\ntions with knowledge and input text. As shown in Fig. 9,\nERNIE [35] proposes a novel word-entity alignment training\nobjective as a pre-training objective. Specifically, ERNIE\nfeeds both sentences and corresponding entities mentioned\nin the text into LLMs, and then trains the LLMs to pre-\ndict alignment links between textual tokens and entities in\nknowledge graphs. Similarly, KALM [91] enhances the input\ntokens by incorporating entity embeddings and includes\nan entity prediction pre-training task in addition to the\ntoken-only pre-training objective. This approach aims to\nimprove the ability of LLMs to capture knowledge related\nto entities. Finally, KEPLER [40] directly employs both\nknowledge graph embedding training objective and Masked\ntoken pre-training objective into a shared transformer-based\nencoder. Deterministic LLM [104] focuses on pre-training\nlanguage models to capture deterministic factual knowledge.\nIt only masks the span that has a deterministic entity as the\nquestion and introduces additional clue contrast learning\nand clue classification objective. WKLM [106] first replaces\nentities in the text with other same-type entities and then\nfeeds them into LLMs. The model is further pre-trained to\ndistinguish whether the entities have been replaced or not.\n4.1.2 Integrating KGs into LLM Inputs\nAs shown in Fig. 10, this kind of research focus on in-\ntroducing relevant knowledge sub-graph into the inputs\nof LLMs. Given a knowledge graph triple and the corre-\nsponding sentences, ERNIE 3.0 [101] represents the triple as\na sequence of tokens and directly concatenates them with\nthe sentences. It further randomly masks either the relation\ntoken in the triple or tokens in the sentences to better\ncombine knowledge with textual representations. However,\nsuch direct knowledge triple concatenation method allows\nthe tokens in the sentence to intensively interact with the\ntokens in the knowledge sub-graph, which could result in\nKnowledge Noise [36]. To solve this issue, K-BERT [36] takes\nthe first step to inject the knowledge triple into the sentence\nvia a visible matrix where only the knowledge entities have\naccess to the knowledge triple information, while the tokens\nin the sentences can only see each other in the self-attention\nmodule. To further reduce Knowledge Noise , Colake [107]\nproposes a unified word-knowledge graph (shown in Fig.\n10) where the tokens in the input sentences form a fully\nInput T ext: Mr. Darcy  gives Elizabeth a letterMr.\nDarcy\nElizabeth gives\na\nletterBeloved\nFatherMr.\nBennetMother JaneLLMs\nMr.\nBennetFatherBelovedMother JaneText GraphKnowledge GraphMr.\nDarcy...

Injecting KG information into LLMs inputs using graph structure.\nconnected word graph where tokens aligned with knowl-\nedge entities are connected with their neighboring entities.\nThe above methods can indeed inject a large amount\nof knowledge into LLMs. However, they mostly focus on\npopular entities and overlook the low-frequent and long-\ntail ones. DkLLM [108] aims to improve the LLMs repre-\nsentations towards those entities. DkLLM first proposes a\nnovel measurement to determine long-tail entities and then\nreplaces these selected entities in the text with pseudo token\nembedding as new input to the large language models.\nFurthermore, Dict-BERT [125] proposes to leverage exter-\nnal dictionaries to solve this issue. Specifically, Dict-BERT\nimproves the representation quality of rare words by ap-\npending their definitions from the dictionary at the end of\ninput text and trains the language model to locally align\nrare word representations in input sentences and dictionary\ndefinitions as well as to discriminate whether the input text\nand definition are correctly mapped.\n4.1.3 KGs Instruction-tuning\nInstead of injecting factual knowledge into LLMs, the KGs\nInstruction-tuning aims to fine-tune LLMs to better com-\nprehend the structure of KGs and effectively follow user\ninstructions to conduct complex tasks. KGs Instruction-\ntuning utilizes both facts and the structure of KGs to cre-\nate instruction-tuning datasets. LLMs finetuned on these\ndatasets can extract both factual and structural knowledge\nfrom KGs, enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs. KP-\nPLM [109] first designs several prompt templates to transfer\nstructural graphs into natural language text. Then, two self-\nsupervised tasks are proposed to finetune LLMs to further\nleverage the knowledge from these prompts. OntoPrompt\n[110] proposes an ontology-enhanced prompt-tuning that\ncan place knowledge of entities into the context of LLMs,\nwhich are further finetuned on several downstream tasks.\nChatKBQA [111] finetunes LLMs on KG structure to gener-\nate logical queries, which can be executed on KGs to obtain\nanswers.

Fine-grained categorization of research on unifying large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs (KGs).\n4 KG- ENHANCED LLM S\nLarge language models (LLMs) achieve promising results\nin many natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs\nhave been criticized for their lack of practical knowledge\nand tendency to generate factual errors during inference.\nTo address this issue, researchers have proposed integrating\nknowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance LLMs. In this sec-\ntion, we first introduce the KG-enhanced LLM pre-training,\nwhich aims to inject knowledge into LLMs during the pre-\ntraining stage. Then, we introduce the KG-enhanced LLM\ninference, which enables LLMs to consider the latest knowl-\nedge while generating sentences. Finally, we introduce the\nKG-enhanced LLM interpretability, which aims to improve\nthe interpretability of LLMs by using KGs. Table 2 summa-\nrizes the typical methods that integrate KGs for LLMs.\n4.1 KG-enhanced LLM Pre-training\nExisting large language models mostly rely on unsupervised\ntraining on the large-scale corpus. While these models may\nexhibit impressive performance on downstream tasks, they\noften lack practical knowledge relevant to the real world.\nPrevious works that integrate KGs into large language mod-\nels can be categorized into three parts: 1) Integrating KGs into\ntraining objective ,2) Integrating KGs into LLM inputs , and 3)\nKGs Instruction-tuning .\n4.1.1 Integrating KGs into Training Objective\nThe research efforts in this category focus on designing\nnovel knowledge-aware training objectives. An intuitive\nidea is to expose more knowledge entities in the pre-training\nobjective. GLM [102] leverages the knowledge graph struc-\nture to assign a masking probability.

"What are GPTZero's business subscription costs, and how accurate is it vs. other detectors for ChatGPT text, esp. after QuillBot paraphrasing?","['Detecting LLM-Generated Text in Computing Education 15\nMost LLM-generated text detectors only support English as the language of LLM-generated text. While one can still\nsend text in other languages, the results do not appear meaningful as we previously showed.\nAs many LLM-generated text detectors are commercial and they are relatively new, there appear to mostly individual\npricing options. GPTZero CopyLeaks, for instance, have business pricing. GPTZero currently has a subscription plan\nfor business users for $19.99USD per month.\nThese detectors might be far less useful for instructors living in countries with weak currency; the pricing options\nare only available in USD.\n5 DISCUSSION\nThe current state of LLM-generated text detectors suggests that they are not yet ready to be trusted blindly for academic\nintegrity purposes or as reliable plagiarism detectors such as Turnitin, MOSS, or JPlag. Our study demonstrates that\ndetectors under-perform compared to the GPT-2 Output Detector and GLTR, which are older and freely available\ndetectors from 2019.\nAt first glance, it appears that LLM-generated text detectors are fairly accurate with human data being correctly\ndetected∼89.59%13while the average accuracy for ChatGPT-generated data is substantially lower; ∼77.42%14. Upon\ndeeper inspection, it is apparent that the number of potential false positives can lead to a wide array of issues, especially\nif being trusted for plagiarism detection at educational institutions.\nDelving further, when a paraphraser (in this case, QuillBot) is utilized the average accuracy is slightly reduced for\nhuman data∼89.02%15but this substantially reduces the accuracy of ChatGPT-generated data ∼49.17%16. This means\nthat in more than half of all cases, ChatGPT-generated data cannot correctly be identified by these detectors. Though,\nsome detectors perform better than others (e.g., GLTR), it is still a serious concern for users of these detectors.\nAdditionally, once non-English languages are introduced, these detectors are easily exacerbated. We investigate\nsubmissions made in Spanish and see that the average accuracy for human data lowers to an average of ∼70.99%17,\nand ChatGPT-generated data reduces to an abysmal ∼17.50%18. Though only Spanish was investigated, it introduces\nthe need for additional research into alternative languages (non-English).\nPresently, all LLM-generated text detectors struggle with languages other than English, code, and special symbols,\nresulting in fairly inaccurate results. As a point of clarity, it would be ideal for these detectors to explicitly state their\nlimitations and aim to produce human predictions in such cases.\nIn terms of usability, LLM-generated text detectors need some improvements. Although they are intuitive to use and\ngenerate acceptable reports, many of them are not well documented at a technical level, some do not have APIs making\nthem more difficult to integrate into local and larger systems (e.g., Learning Management Systems), and the support of\nthese detectors is limited. Furthermore, some of these detectors require processing fees.\nFrom our results, LLM-generated text detectors appear to lack in understandability. We are aware that all of these\ndetectors leverage similar large language models for detection purposes. However, they might differ in terms of their\ntechnical implementation, parameters, pre-trained data, etc. These are unlikely to be revealed since most of the detectors\n13this percentage is the average accuracy for human data using Tables 6 and 7.\n14this percentage is the average accuracy for ChatGPT-generated data using Tables 6 and 7.\n15this percentage is the average accuracy for human data using Tables 9 and 10.\n16this percentage is the average accuracy for ChatGPT-generated data using Tables 9 and 10.\n17this percentage is the average accuracy for human data using Tables 11 and 12.\n18this percentage is the average accuracy for ChatGPT-generated data using Tables 11 and 12.\nManuscript submitted to ACM', 'Detecting LLM-Generated Text in Computing Education 11\nTable 12.

Overall, from the t-tests (Table 6: 𝑡=1.67and 𝑝=0.116, Table 7:\n𝑡=1.154,𝑝=0.268, both with 14 degrees of freedom) we did not find significant differences in the accuracy of\nLLM-generated text detectors between human and ChatGPT data.\nTable 8 shows the false positive results on the human data from the databases and network assignments. GPTKit\nis the only detector that managed to achieve no false positives across the entire set of human submissions. This is\nfollowed by CopyLeaks (1), the GPT-2 Output Detector/CheckForAI (2), OpenAI’s detector (6), OriginalityAI (7), GLTR\n(20), and finally GPTZero (52).\nA further investigation of GPTKit, which appears to be the the best detector for avoiding false positives, shows that\nthis detector is still prone to false positives. While none of our original test samples appeared more than 50% fake,\nwe found that some submissions score up to 37% fake from GPTKit. In some cases, removing the last paragraph(s)\nfrom these submissions led to a false positive. Figures 1 and 2 show such a case. We note that in this case the output\nof GPTKit also shows that the detector merged separate paragraphs into a single one. This unexpected merge may\ncontribute to the problem.\nTable 9 shows results of 10 ChatGPT papers before and after the Quillbot paraphraser. The results are measured\nusing overall accuracy. The GLTR detector was the most resilient, with none of the predictions changing. It is worth\nnoting that the overall weighted result of GLTR also decreased by 10%, although the change did not effect the accuracy.\nIn contrast, the rest of the detector saw a significant drop following the transformation of Quillbot.\nManuscript submitted to ACM']","GPTZero has a subscription plan for business users for $19.99 USD per month.

How do utility and relevance judgments impact LLM answer accuracy in multi-hop vs. single-passage QA?,"[""Are Large Language Models Good at Utility Judgments?

E.g., in NQ, the F1 and NDCG@1 scores for\nutility judgments exhibit a notable increase of 30.98% and 47.90%,\nrespectively, compared to relevance judgments.\nLLM s exhibit distinct performance on multi-hop and single-\npassage QA datasets. (i) In the listwise-rank approach, the perfor-\nmance of utility judgments and relevance judgments is superior on\nthe multi-hop dataset, i.e., HotpotQA, compared to the single-pas-\nsage QA dataset, e.g., NQ. This could be attributed to the presence\nof multiple pieces of ground-truth evidence for each question in\nHotpotQA, leading to a higher probability of the ground-truth evi-\ndence appearing at the top of the ranked list. (ii) In the listwise-set\napproach, the performance of relevance judgments on HotpotQA\nsurpasses that on NQ in terms of F1, likely due to the increased\nprobability of the set containing ground-truth in HotpotQA. How-\never, concerning utility judgments, the F1 score for HotpotQA is\nlower than for NQ. This discrepancy may arise from the LLM s’s\ncapability to address multi-hop questions, where they may not\nrecall all necessary evidence required at each step, consequently\nimpacting their judgment, particularly when selecting precise sets.\nLLM s are highly receptive to generated counterfactual pas-\nsages. (i) In the listwise-set and listwise-rank scenarios, ChatGPT’s\nperformance on MSMARCO-QA is significantly worse than on\nNQ in terms of utility judgments. This disparity may stem fromthe construction of counterfactual passages [ 46]. In NQ, counter-\nfactual passages are built through entity substitution, potentially\nleading to passage incoherence. LLM s might be sensitive to incoher-\nent passages, resulting in their rejection during utility judgments.\nConversely, the construction of counterfactual passages in MSMAR-\nCO-QA involves LLM s generating coherent passages, which may\nconfuse the utility judgments of LLM s. (ii) However, for relevance\njudgments the performance gap between MSMARCO-QA and NQ is\nsmall. This may be because both counterfactual passages and entity\nsubstitution are highly relevant to the question. Consequently, the\nperformance of the results selected based on relevance is low in\nboth listwise-set and listwise-rank forms and remains unaffected\nby different construction approaches of counterfactual passages.\nCase study. Fig. 3 illustrates two examples based on utility and\nrelevance judgments. The evidence selected by LLM s based on\nutility is more precise than that selected based on relevance. When\ngenerating answers using utility judgments results and relevance\njudgments results, respectively, it becomes evident that the noise\nor misinformation in the relevance results significantly impacts\ntheLLM s’s answer generation. E.g., The ”Passage-9” obtained from\nrelevance judgments contains misinformation about the focus of\npaleo diet, which misguides the answer generator’s understanding\nof the paleo diet. This underscores the importance of enhancing\nthe quality of supporting evidence for answer generation.\n4 UTILITY JUDGMENTS DEPEND ON\nINSTRUCTION DESIGN\nOur analysis suggests that utility judgments may offer more effec-\ntive guidance to LLM s in identifying ground-truth evidence for an-\nswering questions. In light of this, we extend our analysis to explore\nhow different factors affect utility judgments ( RQ2). Specifically, we\nexamine key factors in instruction design, including the input form\nof passages (i.e., pointwise, pairwise, and listwise), the sequence of\ninput between the question and passages, and additional require-\nments (i.e., chain-of-thought, reasoning, and providing answers).\nWe evaluate ChatGPT, Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, Vicuna-7B, and"", 'Are Large Language Models Good at Utility Judgments?

For example, Yu et al . [49]\ndemonstrated that using retrieval-augmented methods can improve\nGPT-3 performance on open-domain question answering. However,\nthese retrieval models are usually based on the probability ranking\nprinciple (PRP) [ 52], ranking passages based on their likelihood\nof being relevant to the question [ 50,52], which may not align\nwith a retrieval-augmented framework. In the joint architecture,\ntheLLM s actively engage in the training process of the retriever\n[12,17,39,52]. Shi et al . [39] used the performance of the LLM s in\nanswer generation as feedback to train the retriever to retrieve the\nevidence that contribute more utility to answering the question.\nThe independent retriever may struggle to align well with the\nutility requirements of LLM s on the retrieval passages. Although\njoint architecture partially alleviates this issue, depending on the\nanswers outputted by LLM s as utility judgments for retrieved pas-\nsages is influenced by the LLM s’ internal knowledge. Since LLM s\nmay produce different answers for the same input passages, assess-\ning passage utility based solely on the quality of LLM s’ answers in\njoint architecture may not always accurately reflect the passages’\ninherent utility for answering questions. Therefore, we directly\ninvestigate the LLM s’s capability of utility judgment. We hope our\nwork provides useful insights for understanding and improving\nretrieval-augmented LLMs in the future.\n7 CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we studied the abilities of LLM s to produce utility\njudgments for passages. We have found that LLM s have different\nunderstandings of utility and relevance. Moreover, we have shown\nthat utility judgments of LLM s are influenced by the input forms\nand positions of ground-truth evidence in the input list, none of\nwhich may be a desired property for retrieval-augmented LLM s.\nThe susceptibility of LLM s to these external factors could stem\nfrom a limited instruction-following capability. We anticipate that\nasLLM s continue to advance, the influence of these factors on their\ncapabilities will gradually diminish. Finally, we have found that\nusing utility judgments can further improve the performance of\nanswer generation compared to relevance judgments.As a preliminary exploration into the utility judgments within\nLLM s, our analysis has solely focused on evaluating the utility of\na small set of candidate passages. In the future, it is imperative to\ndevise methodologies for assessing the utility of large-scale can-\ndidate passages within the LLM s. This is essential for enhancing\nutility judgments capabilities in practical applications of retrieval-\naugmented LLM s. Furthermore, we have only scratched the surface\nin exploring the zero-shot utility judgments of LLM s. It is crucial\nto investigate additional scenarios, e.g., the few-shot scenario, to\nfurther uncover the capabilities of LLM s in utility judgments. We\nhope our work provides a solid evaluation testbed and meaning-\nful insights for understanding, improving, and deploying utility\njudgments by LLMs in the future.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of\nthe CAS under Grants No. XDB0680102, the National Key Research\nand Development Program of China under Grants No. 2023YFA1011\n602 and 2021QY1701, the National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (NSFC) under Grants No. 62372431, the Youth Innova-\ntion Promotion Association CAS under Grants No. 2021100, the\nLenovo-CAS Joint Lab Youth Scientist Project, and the project\nunder Grants No. JCKY2022130C039.

Moreover, Self-Contrast is flexible, dynam-\nically designing multiple perspectives tailored to\nuser requests, without the need for manually pre-\nconfiguring agent roles and quantities.\n5The Effect of the Different Components\nThe above results show that Self-Contrast inspires\nreflection more accurately and stably than direct\nevaluation. It encompasses a self-curated promptprocess, which fosters diverse solving perspectives\nto mitigate self-evaluation biases. Besides, it in-\nvolves a checklist generation process to facilitate\nre-examination. We analyze their effect as follows:\nSelf-curated Prompt Vs. Sampling Multiple\nResponses. Instead of self-curated prompt process,\nwe directly sample multiple responses from LLMs\nfor subsequent contrast and reflection. Figure A2\nshows that the final accuracy improves as the num-\nber of sampled responses increases, yet it is still\nlower than Self-Contrast with self-curated prompts\nprocess, where full strategy achieves 84.4% com-\npared to the maximum of 81.8% when sampling\n5 responses. We find that the top-n responses are\nsometimes strikingly similar, diminishing the effec-\ntiveness of the contrastive strategy.\nReflection Without Checklist. We eliminate\nthe checklist generation process, i.e., directly in-\nstruct the LLM to reflect on the differences among\nperspectives. In Table A1, it brings a significant\nimpact on mathematical reasoning (-3.5%), but a\nslight impact on translation (-0.1%), since trans-\nlation tasks tend to focus more on local features.\nEven without a checklist, the LLM also can reflect\nbased on the comparisons of lexical, syntactic.\n6 Analysis\n6.1 Reducing Invalid and Toxic Reflections\nAs mentioned in Table 2, due to overly confident or\nhighly random in the self-evaluate process, vanilla\nself-reflection contains a large amount of invalid\n(✗→✗: 20.3%) or toxic reflections ( ✓→✗: 4%).\nTherefore we investigate how Self-Contrast im-\nproves these two scenarios on GSM8K.

As shown\nin Figure 1 (bottom), we sample Top-2 responses\nfrom LLM and then prompt LLM to contrast their\ndifferences in detail, rethink the reasons that caused\nthe discrepancies, and summarize the checklist for\nre-examining and resolving the discrepancy. As\nshown in Table 3, we compare three scenarios:\nself-evaluate w/ top-1 response, self-evaluate w/\ntop-2 responses, and self-contrast w/ top-2. Our\nnew strategy achieves a modest improvement over\nstandard reflection using self-evaluate. Notably, it\nsignificantly enhances the significance levels (t-test:\n-0.43 to 1.43), suggesting it can greatly mitigate the\nuncertainty associated with self-evaluate process.\n3 Self-Contrast\nPrior sections illustrate the challenges LLMs en-\ncounter in accurately evaluating previous solutions,\noften resulting in overconfident or inconsistent\nfeedback. Concurrently, we observe that leverag-\ning the discrepancies between two different solu-\ntions can catalyze a more efficacious reflection,\nnotably reducing the uncertainty during the reflec-\ntion. Building upon this insight, we propose a more\ndiverse inter-perspective Self-Contrast, facilitating\nmore reliable self-reflection.\nSelf-Contrast consists of three procedures: Cre-\nate Diverse Perspectives, Contrast Inter-Perspective\nDiscrepancies, and Eliminate Discrepancies. In\nCreate Diverse Perspectives ( §3.1), we encour-\nage LLMs to autonomously create a variety of\nprompts tailored to the user’s request, each of-\nfering a unique perspective for problem-solving,\ne.g., different thinking styles, diverse identities,\npersonalities, or preferences. These diverse per-\nspectives prompt the LLM to generate different re-\nsponses. In the second stage ( §3.2), LLM contrasts\nthe differences between each pair of responses.\nLastly ( §3.3), to eliminate discrepancies, we ab-stract these differences into a detailed checklist for\nre-examining. This checklist guides the LLM to\nmeticulously examine the causes of discrepancies,\nincluding random errors or intrinsic biases, which\nresult in inconsistent results among perspectives.\nAs shown in Figure 2, LLM designs five different\nprompts and their translation results based on the\nuser’s request ("" 这个计划被枪毙"") . From a literal\nperspective, the phrase "" 被枪毙"" is translated as\n""shot to death"". This rigid translation fails to grasp\nthe metaphor embedded in the military term. Con-\nversely, from a liberal perspective, it is translated\nas ""This plan was axed"". After contrasting two\ndifferent translations, LLMs believe they should\nscrutinize the source sentence for metaphors and\nensure the translation aligns with the conventions\nof English expression.\n3.1 Create Diverse Perspectives\nSelf-Curated Prompts First, it is imperative to de-\nfine the concept of ""solving perspective"". It refers\nto deliberate prompting with a unique role, person-\nality, thought style, etc., which prompts LLMs to\nsolve user requests from a specific perspective. Di-\nverse solving perspectives can endow LLMs with\na broader range of thoughts for problem-solving,\ne.g., different angles and methodologies, thereby\nmitigating biases introduced by singular prompts.\nTo achieve this, we adopt a self-curated prompt\nstrategy, where the LLM itself adaptively generates\nmultiple different prompts for each request, each\nsignifying a tailored perspective, then samples cor-\nresponding responses based on these prompts. It\nis noteworthy that the number of perspectives to\nbe created, and the design of each perspective are\nentirely determined by LLMs, endowing them with\nmore flexibility to address complex tasks. The de-\ntails of the prompt are provided in Appendix D.1.\nIn Figure 3, we present statistics on the number of\nprompts generated in self-curated prompt process.\n3.2 Contrast Inter-Perspective Discrepancies\nThe LLM generates diverse responses based on self-\ncurated prompts, each representing a specific per-\nspective. Considering that some responses may be\nhighly similar or even identical, we first filter these\nsimilar responses. Then, we select the responses\nwith significant discrepancies for comparison.\nSelecting To filter out similar responses, we em-\nploy the K-Medoids clustering algorithm based\non their semantic similarity. We categorize all re-\nsponses into kclusters, each encompassing a set']","Self-curated prompting improves LLMs' math reasoning and creative translation by fostering diverse solving perspectives, which mitigates self-evaluation biases. It involves a checklist generation process to facilitate re-examination.

How do numerical-to-language transformation and external knowledge improve LLMs in time series forecasting?,"['fectively grasp the periodic nature of time series\ndata, moving beyond a mere emphasis on the tail of\nthe time series. Transforming numerical data into\na natural language format enhances the model’s\nability to comprehend and reason, also serving as\na beneficial approach. Both approaches improve\nmodel performance and contribute to our under-\nstanding of LLMs in time series forecasting. The\nworkflow is illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe key contributions are as follows:\n•We investigate the LLMs’ preferences for the in-\nput sequences in time series forecasting.

Be-\nsides, our results reveal a limitation in LLMs’\nperformance when confronted with multi-period\ntime series datasets. It indicates that LLMs face\nchallenges in recognizing the distinct periods in-\nherent in such datasets. To further discern the\nLLMs’ preferences for the specific segments of\nthe input data, we add Gaussian to the origi-\nnal time series to create counterfactual instances.\nOur results indicate that large language models\nare sensitive to the segment of input sequences\nproximate to the output. All these findings sug-\ngest a potential area for improvement in LLMs’\nadaptability to complex temporal structures.\n•Through prompt design and the use of in-context\nLearning, we have verified that LLMs make bet-\nter predictions on datasets that exhibit strong\ntrends or seasonality, showing that these mod-\nels can precisely identify dataset periodicity.\n•We propose two simple techniques to improve\nmodel performance and find that incorporating\nexternal knowledge in prompts and paraphras-\ning natural language positively affects the perfor-\nmance of LLMs in time series forecasting.\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Large Language Model\nWe use LLMs as a zero-shot learner for time series\nforecasting by treating numerical values as text\nsequences. The success of LLMs in time series\nforecasting can significantly depend on correct pre-\nprocessing and handling of the data (Gruver et al.,\n2023). We followed their approach and this process\ninvolves a few crucial steps.In the pre-processing phase for time series fore-\ncasting with LLMs, numerical values are trans-\nformed into strings, a crucial step that significantly\ninfluences the model’s comprehension and data pro-\ncessing. For instance, a series like 0.123, 1.23, 12.3,\n123.0 is reformatted to ""1 2, 1 2 3, 1 2 3 0, 1 2 3\n0 0"", introducing spaces between digits and com-\nmas to delineate time steps, while decimal points\nare omitted to save token space. Tokenization is\nequally pivotal, shaping the model’s pattern recog-\nnition capabilities. Unlike traditional methods like\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE) (Hugging Face, 2023),\nwhich may disrupt numerical coherence, spacing\ndigits ensures individual tokenization, enhancing\npattern discernment.\nMoreover, rescaling is employed to efficiently\nutilize tokens and manage large inputs by adjusting\nvalues so a specific percentile aligns to 1, facilitat-\ning the model’s exposure to varying digit counts\nand supporting the generation of larger values, a\ntestament to the nuanced yet critical nature of data\npreparation in leveraging LLMs for time series\nanalysis.\n2.2 Time Series Forecasting\nIn the context of time-series forecasting, the pri-\nmary goal is to predict the values for the next H\nsteps based on observed values from the preceding\nKsteps, which is mathematically expressed as:\nˆXt, ...,ˆXt+H−1=F(Xt−1, ..., X t−K;V;λ)(1)\nHere, ˆXt, ...,ˆXt+H−1represents the H-step\nestimation given the previous K-step values\nXt−1, ..., X t−K.λdenotes the trained parameters\nfrom the model F, and Vdenotes the prompt or\nany other information used for the inference. This\npaper predominantly focuses on single-variate time\nseries forecasting.\nMotivated by the interpretability requirements\nin real-world scenarios, time series can often be de-\ncomposed into the trend component, the seasonal\ncomponent, and the residual component through\nthe addictive model (Cleveland et al., 1990). The\ntrend component captures the hidden long-term\nchanges in the data, such as the linear or exponen-\ntial pattern. The seasonal component captures the\nrepeating variation in the data, and the residual\ncomponent captures the remaining variation in the\ndata after the removal of trend and seasonal com-\nponents. This decomposition offers a method to\nquantify the properties of the time series, which is\ndetailed in section 3.2.', 'Time Series Forecasting with LLMs:\nUnderstanding and Enhancing Model Capabilities\nMingyu Jin1,∗, Hua Tang2,∗, Chong Zhang3,∗, Qinkai Yu3, Chengzhi Liu3,\nSuiyuan Zhu5,Yongfeng Zhang1,Mengnan Du4\n1Rutgers University,2Shanghai Jiao Tong University,3University of Liverpool,\n4New Jersey Institute of Technology,5New York University\nAbstract\nLarge language models (LLMs) have been ap-\nplied in many fields with rapid development\nin recent years. As a classic machine learn-\ning task, time series forecasting has recently\nreceived a boost from LLMs. However, there is\na research gap in the LLMs’ preferences in this\nfield. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with\ntraditional models, many properties of LLMs in\ntime series prediction are found. For example,\nour study shows that LLMs excel in predicting\ntime series with clear patterns and trends but\nface challenges with datasets lacking periodic-\nity. We explain our findings through designing\nprompts to require LLMs to tell the period of\nthe datasets. In addition, the input strategy is\ninvestigated, and it is found that incorporat-\ning external knowledge and adopting natural\nlanguage paraphrases positively affects the pre-\ndictive performance of LLMs for time series.\nOverall, this study contributes to insight into\nthe advantages and limitations of LLMs in time\nseries forecasting under different conditions.\n1 Introduction\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have been\nwidely used, achieving promising performance\nacross various domains, such as health manage-\nment, customer analysis, and text feature min-\ning (Peng et al., 2023; Ledro et al., 2022; Huang\net al., 2023). Time series forecasting requires\nextrapolation from sequential observations. Lan-\nguage models, designed to discern intricate con-\ncepts within temporally correlated sequences, in-\ntuitively appear well-suited for this task. Hence,\nLLMs demonstrate proficiency in the domain of\ntime series forecasting (Gruver et al., 2023; Rasul\net al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023).\nCurrently, the application of LLMs for time se-\nries prediction is at a nascent stage, with the bound-\naries of this research area remaining ill-defined.\nThe utilization of proprietary large language mod-\nels in this domain lacks a clear, established method-ology. Our objective is to shed light on this emerg-\ning field, offering valuable insights and guidance\nfor future research endeavors. However, the LLMs’\npreferences for the input time series remain unex-\nplored, such as their proficiency in forecasting both\nseasonal and trend data. We believe that studying\nthis area clearly will greatly improve the perfor-\nmance of LLM in time series forecasting.\nTo fill this research gap, in this paper, we focus\non the question of what are LLMs’ preferences for\nthe input time series in time series forecasting. To\nanswer this, we conduct experiments on both real\nand synthesized datasets. Our observations reveal\nthat LLMs perform better on time series character-\nized by higher trend or seasonal strengths. To fur-\nther discern the LLMs’ preferences for the specific\nsegments of the input data, we design counterfac-\ntual experiments involving systematic permutations\nof input sequences. We find that LLMs are sensi-\ntive to the segment of input sequences proximate\nto the output.\nNaturally, we are interested in the question: Why\ndo LLMs forecast well on datasets with higher\ntrend or seasonal strengths? To solve this, we de-\nsign prompts that require LLMs to tell the period\nof the datasets. Through experiments, we let the\nlarge language model tell the period of the dataset\nseveral times and take the median. We found that\nthe large language model can accurately pinpoint\nthe periodicity of a dataset. This can explain why\nlarge language models can predict data sets with\nhigh trends or seasonal intensities well since they\nalready learned this kind of knowledge.\nIn light of these findings, our focus lies on how\nto leverage these insights to further improve model\nperformance. To address this, we propose two sim-\nple techniques to enhance model performance: in-\ncorporating external human knowledge and con-\nverting numerical sequences into natural language\ncounterparts.

"How does L IBRO's bug reproduction with code-davinci-002 compare to StarCoder, and what factors affect it?","['16\n9 C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduce L IBRO , a technique that uses a\npretrained LLM to analyze bug reports, generate prospec-\ntive tests, and finally rank and suggest the generated solu-\ntions based on a number of simple statistics.

Our evaluation of our selection and rank-\ning techniques also show that they are capturing general\nproperties of LLMs for bug reproduction, as the heuristics\nwork in the same manner over all LLMs evaluated. We\nhope that our experiments and results are of use to both\nresearchers and practitioners when deciding which LLM\nwould be appropriate for their application, and plan to\ncontinue researching the productive capabilities of open-\nsource LLMs.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

Based on this, we\ndescribe our approach in Section 3. Evaluation settings and\nresearch questions are in Section 4 and Section 5, respec-\ntively. Results are presented in Section 6, Section 7 provides\nin-depth discussion of our technique, Section 8 gives an\noverview of the relevant literature, and Section 9 concludes.\n2 M OTIVATION\n2.1 Bug Reproduction\nAs described in the previous section, generating bug-\nreproducing tests from bug reports is important for both\ndevelopers and automated techniques. First, Koyuncu et\nal. [4] report that Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL)\ntechniques cannot locate the bug at the time of being re-\nported in 95% of the cases they analyzed, due to the lack\nof a bug-reproducing test when the report was first filed.\nOther studies show that developers use bug-reproducing\ntests extensively when doing debugging themselves: for\nexample, Beller et al. [3] note that 80% of developers would\nuse bug-reproducing tests to verify fixes. Automatic bug re-\nproduction is also important as the report-to-test problem is\na perhaps underappreciated yet nonetheless important and\nrecurring part of testing. Kochhar et al. [13], for example,\nexplicitly ask hundreds of developers on whether they agree\nto the statement “during maintenance, when a bug is fixed,\nit is good to add a test case that covers it”, and find a strong\naverage agreement of 4.4 on a Likert scale of 5.\nTo further verify that developers regularly deal with\nthe report-to-test problem, we analyze the number of test\nadditions that can be attributed to a bug report, by mining\nhundreds of open-source Java repositories. We start withtheJava-med dataset from Alon et al. [14], which consists of\n1000 top-starred Java projects from GitHub. From the list of\ncommits in each repository, we check (i) whether the commit\nadds a test, and (ii) whether the commit is linked to an\nissue. To determine whether a commit adds a test, we check\nthat its diff adds the @Test decorator along with a test body.\nIn addition, we link a commit to a bug report (or an issue\nin GitHub) if (i) the commit message mentions ""(fixes/re-\nsolves/closes) #NUM"", or (ii) the commit message mentions\na pull request, which in turn mentions an issue. We compare\nthe number of tests added by such report-related commits\nto the size of the test suite at the time of gathering (August\n2022) to estimate the prevalence of such tests. As different\nrepositories have different issue-handling practices, we filter\nout repositories that have no issue-related commits that add\ntests, as this indicates a different bug handling practice (e.g.\ngoogle/guava ). Accordingly, we analyze 300 repositories, as\nshown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1: Analyzed repository characteristics\nRepository Characteristic # Repositories\nCould be cloned 970\nHad a JUnit test ( @Test is found in repository) 550\nHad issue-referencing commit that added test 300\nOverall, in these 300 repositories that we inspected,\nthe number of tests that were added by issue-referencing\ncommits was on median 28.4% of the overall test suite size.\nWhile one must note that due to code evolution, this may\nnot mean that 28.4% of all current tests were added by bug\nreports, overall these results suggest a substantial portion of\nbugs are being added via bug reports, supporting our claim\nthat test addition after bug reproduction is a common task\nthat developers face. In turn, automating the report-to-test\nactivity could provide substantial benefit to developers, and\nwould help them within their existing workflow.\nHowever, the problem has been difficult for researchers\nto tackle until recently, due to the difficulties of natural\nlanguage processing and corresponding code synthesis. For\nexample, the bug report in Table 2 does not explicitly\nspecify any code, which would make this report difficult\nto automatically process for traditional techniques, even\nthough a user fluent in English and Java would be capable\nof deducing that when both arguments are NaN, the ‘equals’\nmethods in ‘MathUtils’ should return false . As a result,\nmost existing work focused on reproducing crashes [15],\n[16].\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), which have been pre-\ntrained on large corpora of natural language and program-\nming language data, may provide a potential solution to\ntame this difficulty. LLMs show a surprising level of per-\nformance on both natural language processing [6] and soft-\nware engineering [10], [17] tasks. Their capability, and the\nrecent introduction of many different open-source LLMs as\ndescribed in the next subsection, thus poses the question of\nwhether this emerging technology could be used to alleviate\ndeveloper effort in writing tests from bug reports.\n2.2 Open-source Large Language Models\nWhile Brown et al.

By\nshedding light on the lack of awareness regarding LLM biases and\nhallucinations, our study calls for a fundamental reevaluation of\nthe way we design, deploy, and educate users about AI-powered\nassistants.\nWe now reflect on our key insights and highlight opportunities\nfor designing LLM assistance for feature-rich software tasks while\npromoting transparent, responsible LLM interfaces to enhance user\nunderstanding and mental model formation. Our findings will be\nvaluable for IUI and HCI researchers, interface designers, developers\nand others working on LLM-powered assistants.\n5.1 Integrating LLM help into feature-rich\napplications\nOur results demonstrate the value that LLM-based assistants, such\nas ChatGPT, can provide in generating relevant software-related\nassistance within a single platform. Unlike traditional help-seeking\nresources and chatbots (e.g., Google search, blogs, Siri, etc.) where\nusers have to assimilate help content through multiple outlets, our\nparticipants appreciated receiving relevant detailed instructions by\ntyping in a prompt. Having said that, our findings resonates with\nthe speculations of other researchers [ 20] that Baseline GPT-4 is not\nmeant to provide assistance for all types of tasks. Our SoftAIBot,\nthat was optimized for particular feature-rich software guidance\ncontext, performed better and generated more relevant and accurate\nstep-by-step software assistance. In our approach, we employed\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on standard software doc-\numentation. Future developments could involve instruction tuning\n[53], which includes pairing more specific instructions with the\nsoftware-specific steps and correlating this with expected output.\nThe onus should transition from users to software developers and\ncustomer support to create such instructional pairs for ensuring\nthem to be crafted in a manner that allows general-purpose LLMs\nto be fine-tuned [ 30] for generating user-centered and optimized\nsoftware guidance.\nWhile SoftAIBot generated relevant and accurate software assis-\ntance compared to Baseline ChatGPT, there were obvious limita-\ntions as users were not able to leverage this information to complete\nthe software tasks accurately. In particular, users found the textual\nLLM output to be limiting compared to other visual-based help-\nseeking mediums. For example, software instructions on YouTube\nallow users to follow procedural steps “as is” without needing to\nverify and locate specific features. However, with LLMs, users had\ndifficulty in mapping the LLM output to features in the software,\nespecially in cases where the LLM was hallucinating and referred to\nnon-existent features. Video-based help-seeking mediums should\nnot be dismissed as instructional tools. Instead, to mitigate the issueof locating the exact instructions that users experience with videos,\nthere is an opportunity for technologies like ChatGPT to aid in video\nsummarization tasks and to extract more relevant snippets from\nvideos [15], enhancing the ease of locating specific information.\n5.2 Transparent and Responsible Interface\nDesign of LLMs\nAt a more fundamental level, our study raises some caution: while\ndevelopers and researchers are investing in improving AI models\nand how LLMs can provide context-specific guidance, users may\nnot always perceive these enhancements as substantial improve-\nments in accuracy and relevance. Recent literature has already\nraised concerns about users’ over-reliance on AI systems, such as\nin the context of AI-based maze-solving tasks [ 49]. Although the\nlandscape of user behaviors and mental models is more multifaceted\nwith LLMs, our study demonstrates a similar phenomena of over-\ntrust with LLMs. Furthermore, we extend prior works by revealing\nthe nuances in users’ mental models of the LLMs triggered by the\ninherent biases of LLMs, leading to overtrust and users’ failure to\nrecognize erroneous or hallucinated output: “ Because it is AI, how\ncan it be wrong? I am going to stop using my brain as I literally gave\nit gibberish and still it works. I [will] doubt myself before doubting AI . ”\n(P15) Such overtrust in LLM assistants can be dangerous, especially\nfor novice users who do not have familiarity with the underlying\npowerful AI technology. These findings from our study underscore\nthe complexity of user interactions with AI and highlight the need\nfor more transparency in addressing users’ expectations and mis-\nconceptions. This can be as critical as advancing the underlying AI\ntechnologies and it is essential to design interfaces that are more\ntransparent and responsible [ 45]. There is need to consider more in-\nnovative user-centered solutions for mitigating bias and enhancing\ntransparency in AI systems, thereby contributing to the responsible\nand ethical development of AI technologies.\nTo enhance the transparency of LLMs among end-users, one ap-\nproach could be to embed interpretability within these systems. By\narticulating why andhow LLMs derive specific recommendations,\nusers can gain perspectives into the underlying mechanisms and\ntrust the provided instructions with a higher degree of certainty.\nOne possible direction is through the illustration of confidence\npercentage scores for each LLM instruction as these scores have\nshown to enhance the perception of transparency and trust [ 21].\nOther potential direction is through explainability techniques [ 37]\n(e.g., visual example-based explanations [ 9,21]) that can indicate\nwhy the system did what it did and verify an AI’s recommendation\n[13] by demonstrating the similarities between users’ intent and\nexamples in the training set [ 9,21,27,28]. Training datasets of\nthese LLMs needs to be designed such that confidence scores or\nvisual examples are part of the dataset to enhance transparency\nwithin the LLM technologies. Such innovative advancements in\nLLM development not only pave the way for enhanced user inter-\naction but also ensure that the model’s suggestions are verifiable\nand reliable.\n5.3 Bridging the Gap Between Mental Models\nand LLM Interfaces\nWith the rapid pace of innovations in Generative AI and LLMs,\nthere is need for HCI research to focus on understanding user', 'Why and When LLM-Based Assistants Can Go Wrong IUI ’24, March 18–21, 2024, Greenville, SC, USA\nhas shown that developers can face new challenges in ensuring\naccurate and effective use of this new avenue of conversational\nUX experience [ 29,52]. As many of these interfaces are still at a\nnascent stage, it is unclear how this current practice (i.e., integrat-\ning the context of these feature-rich applications) can help novice\nend-users in seeking accurate and relevant assistance from LLMs.\nFurthermore, to harness the full potential of these LLM assistants\nfor seeking help for their software tasks, we need more insights on\nwhere and how users struggle with these LLMs [ 31]. Our study con-\ntributes new knowledge on how non-AI expert end-users employ\nLLMs’ generated software guidance assistance in accomplishing\ntasks for feature-rich applications by comparing our own imple-\nmented, SoftAIBot, an LLM optimized for particular domain context\n(e.g., software documentation) with the Baseline ChatGPT.\n2.3 Prompt-based interactions\nTo leverage the potential of LLMs, a lot of the focus in HCI and AI\nresearch is turning to prompt-based interactions as users generally\nhave to provide input or queries in the form of prompts that are\nthen processed or responded to by a conversational AI system\n[52]. Recent studies on the usability of prompt-based interactions\n[5,41,51] reveal that prompts have a significant impact on pre-\ntrained language models’ ability to produce desired outputs, even\nthough the prompts themselves are simple textual instructions for\nthe task at hand [ 52]. For example, Advait et. al’s (2022) [ 41] study\non the use of LLM-assisted tools for programming tasks revealed\nthat the crucial concern is crafting effective prompts that elevate the\nprobability of an LLM model to generate efficient code. Thus, the\nbig challenge for end-users, especially novices and non-AI experts,\nis to define the appropriate prompts and learn prompting strategies\nto get the desired assistance from these LLMs.\nUnlike traditional help-seeking mediums that rely on keyword\nmatching, prompt-based interactions within LLMs offer human-\nlike language capabilities [ 29], which is unique, but can also be\nunreliable. This unreliability comes from the biases (e.g., hallucinat-\ning and non-deterministic output) inherent within prompt-based\ninteractions of LLMs. Considering LLMs are a tremendous leap\nfrom traditional help-seeking mediums that most users are famil-\niar with, there have been calls to investigate users’ mental models\nas they interact with LLMs [ 29]. This becomes necessary when\nseeking assistance for feature-rich software tasks, where there is\nan interplay between the mental model of LLM vs the software\napplication [ 22,29]. Recent studies have focused on understanding\nusers’ prompting strategies and proposing a catalogue of prompting\nguidelines [ 42,44,50] for allowing users to craft better prompts\nand seek desired LLM assistance. However, the use of these prompt\nguidelines in practice and their effectiveness remains unclear. Our\nstudy complements the existing research by observing users with\nprompt-based interactions and assessing the efficacy of prompt-\nbased guidelines and integration of domain context in enhancing\nLLM assistance for software tasks.\n3 METHOD: CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT\nAND FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS\nWe conducted a two-part user study with 16 users that consisted\nof a controlled experiment and follow-up interviews. Our maingoal in this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two recent\nadvancements: 1) prepending prompt guidelines to user prompts\nto enhance the accuracy of LLM output, as advocated by OpenAI,\nMicrosoft and others to enhance Generative AI tools [ 42,44]; and, 2)\ndirectly integrating domain context (e.g., software documentation)\ninto LLM assistants (e.g., as demonstrated in Copilot in Microsoft\n365 applications [ 43] and Firefly in Adobe applications [ 1], etc.) to\nenhance the relevance and accuracy of LLM output for software-\nrelated tasks. For our investigation, we implemented both of these\nadvancements in a new GPT-4-based assistant, which we call Soft-\nAIBot , that offers in-context prompt guidelines (See Figure 1) and\nenhances the LLM output by making it specific to the feature-rich\napplication (See Figure 1.c). For comparison, we also implemented\nBaseline ChatGPT based on the pre-trained state-of-the-art LLM\nassistants, ChatGPT. (SoftAIBot is explained in more detail below.)\nThe prompt suggestions were not included in the Baseline ChatGPT\nbecause it was a control condition for the experiment.\nBased on our research questions, we derived the following hy-\npotheses for users seeking software help:\n•H1:Users will perceive SoftAIBot as being more accurate\nthan Baseline ChatGPT.\n•H2: Users will perceive SoftAIBot as being more relevant\nthan Baseline ChatGPT.\n•H3:Users will trust SoftAIBot more than Baseline ChatGPT.\n•H4:Users will find the output provided by SoftAIBot to be\neasier to apply in the software application than Baseline\nChatGPT.\n3.1 Participants\nWe recruited 16 participants (9F |7M) for our study, focusing on non-\nAI expert users who had little to no prior experience or knowledge\nof ML or NLP. Our participants came from different backgrounds\n(CS, Engineering, Business, Arts) and professions (administrative\nservices, business analytics, information designers, client services,\nstudents, and researchers). Participants were familiar with LLM-\nbased assistant, ChatGPT (10/16), and a range of traditional chatbots\n(12/16) such as Siri, and Google Assistant (12/14). They had used\nChatGPT before for text generation, text summarization, and pro-\ngramming tasks, but none of them used it for software tasks used in\nthe study before. About half of the participants (7/16) had frequently\nused PowerPoint and Excel applications and the remaining were\noccasional users. Our participants covered a range of age groups:\n18-24 (25%), 25-34 (62%), 35-44 (13%) and had different levels of ed-\nucation (2 Diploma, 4 Bachelor’s, 5 Master’s, 5 PhD). We recruited\nparticipants mainly from our university’s mailing lists and found\nadditional participants through snowball sampling.\n3.2 Design and Implementation of SoftAIBot\nand Baseline ChatGPT\nIn this section, we describe the design and system implementation\nof our two interventions.\n3.2.1 SoftAIBot Intervention (GPT-4 with Prompt Guidelines\nand Software Documentation) .SoftAIBot LLM intervention\nsuggests in-context prompt guidelines for constructing prompts']","Prompt-based interactions and domain-specific context in LLMs like SoftAIBot boost user trust and accuracy in software tasks by providing more relevant and accurate step-by-step software assistance compared to traditional help-seeking resources.

How do continuous vectors in prompt-tuning ease labor and computational demands vs. traditional model-tuning in clinical NLP?,"['types of prompt shapes including (1) “hard prompts” (or discrete prompts) – a piece of text composed by researchers providing information about the target prediction, and (2) “soft prompts” (or continuous prompts) – a continuous vector (of virtual tokens) attached to the input.  To adopt LLMs for specific downstream applications, researchers either adopt the traditional fine-tuning to keep updating the pretrained LLMs – known as “model-tuning”, or to freeze the LLMs and only update the soft prompts – known as “prompt-tuning” or “p-tuning”.[6]  Most studies in clinical NLP focus on hard prompts as ChatGPT adopted this strategy and achieved a breakthrough in conversational AI.  However, designing hard prompts is very labor-intensive, and recent studies have shown that LLMs are very sensitive to hard prompts.  Therefore, many recent studies started exploring prompt-tuning using soft prompts. Prompt-tuning offers many benefits over model-tuning, especially in reducing the computing and memory costs as LLMs are frozen during the fine-tuning.  Another important benefit of freezing LLMs in prompt-tuning is that we can deploy one single LLM for multiple tasks in the real-world healthcare applications.  However, early-stage studies on prompt-tuning using smaller LLMs have shown that freezing LLMs often does not yield good performance that is competitive with model-tuning.  Most recently, several studies further explored prompt-tuning and demonstrated promising results by scaling up the model size to exceed billions of parameters.   LLMs have many potentials in medical research and healthcare.  An important application of clinical NLP is patient information extraction from clinical narratives. Clinical concept extraction (or named entity recognition [NER]) and relation extraction (RE) are two fundamental NLP tasks for patient information extraction.[7]  Various solutions, including rule-based [8–10]  traditional machine learning-based models, [11–14] and deep learning model [15–17] have been developed ', 'INTRODUCTION Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have almost become standard solutions for clinical natural language processing.  In the recent decade, the natural language processing (NLP) community has witnessed a dramatic change from fully supervised learning architecture – where the “one model per task” strategy was adopted and all model parameters were tuned (i.e., updated) during training, to pretraining/fine-tuning architecture – where one pretrained LLM can be adapted to various NLP tasks through fine-tuning, and eventually to prompt-based learning architecture [1]  – where a prompt was attached to the input to condition the output on not only model parameters but also prompts.  Prompt-based learning offers many advantages including better few-shot, zero-shot, and transfer learning ability as well as the freedom to control model output using prompts, which is a key technology in achieving conversational artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT. [1–3]  At present, the performance of prompt-based learning highly depends on (1) the “shape” of the prompts, i.e., hard/discrete prompts (in clear text) or soft/continuous prompts, and (2) algorithms to adopt LLMs for downstream tasks. Currently, there are two strategies to fine-tune LLMs for downstream tasks, including “model-tuning” – updating LLMs parameters in training, or “prompt-tuning” – updating soft prompts while keeping LLMs frozen.  Prompt-tuning with frozen LLMs offers many benefits over model-tuning including (1) enabling machines to learn “soft prompts” to unload researchers from labor-intensive prompt engineering (i.e., human manually compose hard prompts using clear text), and (2) reducing computing cost by keeping LLMs frozen; and (3) enabling one model for multiple downstream tasks to greatly reduce the development and deployment cost.  Nevertheless, most existing works in prompt-based clinical NLP are based on hard prompts using model-tuning; there is a lack of studies exploring the use of soft prompts and prompt-tuning algorithms. This study seeks to develop a soft prompt-based ']","Continuous vectors in prompt-tuning ease labor and computational demands by enabling machines to learn 'soft prompts,' which reduces the need for labor-intensive prompt engineering (manual composition of hard prompts).

Focusing on the reliability and transparency aspects of LLMs, this pa-per contributes to a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of LLMs in this context. It lays the groundwork for the development and adoption of a comprehensive LLM maturity model, facilitat-ing the assessment and deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. An important future direction involves conducting extensive empirical studies and assessments on the top-ranked LLMs from various accuracy-dominated leaderboards. These assessments would ', 'selection of filters on the user interface.

How do LLMs' biases and output inconsistency affect their use in social psychology for modeling behavior and interactions?,"[""potential and limitations.  \nKasneci et al. \n(2023)  Opportunities and \nchallenges of LLMs in \neducation.  LLM s can help create and design educational \ncontent, provide personalized learning experiences, \naid in language learning, research, and writing, \nconduct assessments and grading, and facilitate \nprofessional development.  LLMs have great potential in \neducation and can provide many \nbenefits to students and teachers \n(e.g., personalizing instruction, \nincreasing student engagement \nand interaction, and creating \neducational content for learners \nwith diverse needs).  \nCai et al. \n(2023)  Explore whether the \nChatGPT is similar to \nhumans in language \ncomprehension and \nproduction, and how it \nperforms on multiple \npsycholinguistic tasks.  12 pre-registered psycholinguistic experiments : \nSpeech: sound -shape association. Speech: sound -\ngender association. Words: word length and \npredictivity . Words: word meaning priming.  Syntax: \nstructural priming. Syntax: syntactic ambiguity \nresolution.  Meaning: implausible sentence \ninterpretation. Meaning: semantic illusions. \nDiscourse: implicit causality. Discourse: drawing \ninferences. Interlocutor sensitivity: word meaning \naccess. Interlocutor sensitivity: lexical retrieval. \nInterlocutor sensitivity: word mea ning access . ChatGPT shares similarities \nwith humans in language \ncomprehension and production \nbut also shows different patterns \nin some areas.  \nAli et al. \n(2023)  Explore the impact of \nChatGPT on English \nlanguage students' \nmotivation from teachers' \nand students' \nperspectives.  A five-point Likert scale was used to collect \ninformation about participants' perceptions of the \nimpact of the ChatGPT on learning English, as well \nas whether or not the ChatGPT increased the \nstudents' interest in English language learning, self -\ndirected le arning,  interacting with others, and the \nenjoyment and pleasure of learning English.  ChatGPT positively impacts the \nmotivation of English language \nlearners.  \nKosinski \n(2023)  Explores whether LLMs \nspontaneously generate \nTheoretical Minds.  The researchers used two types of gold -standard \nfalse-belief tasks: the Unexpected Contents task, \nalso known as the Smarties task, and the Unexpected \nTransfer task, also known as the Maxi task or Sally -\nAnne test . ToM, previously thought to be a \nuniquely human ability, may \nhave emerged spontaneously as \na byproduct of LLMs' improved \nlanguage skills.  \n \n5. LLMs in social and cultural psychology  \nIn time scales of human behavior  (Newell, 1990) , social and cultural psychology covers a predominantly \nlong-term dimension (see Fig.1), reflecting its focus not only on social interactions but also on the long -term \nbehavioral patterns and mental processes of individuals in their social environments. So cial and cultural \npsychology studies how individual behavior is influenced by the social and cultural environment and others \nand how individuals affect  the social and cultural environment and others. These studies usually focus on \ninterpersonal interaction s (Tajfel, 1982) , group behavior, attitude formation and change, and social cognition. \nLLMs  can simulate human responses and behaviors and be used to test theories and hypotheses of human \nbehavior  (Grossmann et al., 2023) . In social and cultural psychology, LLMs can  revolutionize the field by \nanalyzing large amounts of textual data, modeling social interactions, and providing valuable insights into \nhuman behavior and social dynamics  (Salah et al., 2023) .  \nFirst, LLMs  share many similarities with humans regarding  social cognition. For example, research has \nfound that LLMs have a variety of typical  human cognitive biases in judgment and decision -making, such "", 'Third, in fields such as educational , developmental, and social and cultural psychology, LLMs face \nproblems and challenges in their application. For example, when applied in education, LLMs have the \npotential for output bias  and misuse (Kasneci et al., 2023) . One study found that the texts generated by \nChatGPT were not always consistent or logical and sometimes even contradictory  (Stojanov, 2023) . In the \nfield of social and cultural psychology, LLMs exhibit cognitive biases (Talboy & Fuller, 2023)  and cultural \nbiases (Atari et al., 2023)  similar to those of humans, in addition to implicitly darker personality patterns  (X. \nLi et al., 2022) . Field Bender et al. (2021) have argued that training data for LLMs may reflect social biases \nthat continue to be perpetuated in research settings.   \nFinally, as an aid to scientific research, LLMs have some limitations. For example, when it comes to \nwriting, LLMs currently do not fully replace humans . Instead , they  answer questions and generate naturally \nflowing and informative content compellingly, without real intelligence, only generating text based on \npreviously seen word patterns (Stokel -Walker, 2022) . Although macrolanguage models can simulate human \njudgments when used as experimental subjects , there are still limits to their understanding of human thought \n(Dillion et al., 2023) . Field Van Dis et al. (2023) noted that  LLM s may accelerate innovation , shorten \npublication times, and increase scientific diversity and equality . However, they  may also reduce the quality \nand transparency of research and fundamentally alter scientists\' autonomy as human researchers.   \nIn summary, while LLMs offer extraordinary capabilities for psychological research, they also present \nchallenges related to bias, ethical issues, data security, transparency, and technical expertise. Researchers \nshould be fully aware of these challenges wh en using big language models and take steps to address them \nresponsibly in their research projects.  The following table summarizes  the challenges and limitations of \nLLMs  in psychological applications  (see Table 6).  \n \nTable 6 Challenges  and limitations of LLMs  in psychological applications . \nAuthor  Domain  Challenges and limitations  \nMitchell (2023)  Cognition and Behavior  Lack of real -world understanding .

How do LR challenges in LLM fine-tuning intersect with LRBench++ opportunities for budget-friendly accuracy?,"['policy, such as the cosine decaying LR or WarmupLR [22],\n[42], [73], which may not achieve the optimal LLM fine-\ntuning results. For example, Table V shows that simply using\na fixed LR of 2×10−5can achieve the best performance\non both ARC and HellaSwag, which also outperforms the\npopular cosine decaying LR of 2×10−5adopted by Vicuna-\n7B [23] and WizardLM-7B [70] in Table VI. This further\nconfirms our previous analysis and demonstrates the pressing\nneed to rethink learning rate tuning for both DNN and LLM\ntraining/fine-tuning.\nChallenges and Opportunities in LR Tuning. We below\ndiscuss the challenges and opportunities in LR tuning from\nthree perspectives. (1) Cost-effective LR tuning: given the\nsubstantial computational costs of LLM training/fine-tuning, it\nis both challenging and costly to perform an exhaustive search\nof potential LR policies for a new LLM or a new learning\ntask. From a practical perspective, it presents an attractive\nresearch opportunity to identify effective learning rate poli-\ncies or tuning strategies that can efficiently achieve desired\nmodel accuracy within a given budget. (2) Benchmarking\nLR: this challenge lies in how to accurately capture the LR\nimpacts on DNN/LLM training/fine-tuning in terms of dif-\nferent hyperparameter configurations, costs, and trained/fine-\ntuned model quality. (3) LLM Performance Evaluation\nduring Training/Fine-tuning : in Section V, we found that\nthe training/validation loss during the LLM fine-tuning may\nnot effectively reflect the LLM task-specific performance, such\nas ARC or HellaSwag tests. This suggests that the state-\nbased LRs that rely on monitoring the training/validation\nloss, such as Reduce-LR-On-Plateau [43] and Change-LR-On-\nPlateau [39], may not work well for LLM training/fine-tuning.\nIt will be challenging and valuable to study how to evaluate\nLLM task-specific performance during LLM training/fine-\ntuning to obtain timely feedback for LR tuning.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nWe revisit the changes from traditional DNNs to Large\nLanguage Models in fundamental assumptions and identify\nthe core research challenges and opportunities in learning rate\ntuning through an empirical study. This paper makes three\noriginal contributions. First, we examine existing learning rate\npolicies with the goal of improving traditional deep learning\ntraining and LLM fine-tuning efficiency. Second, we present\nLRBench++, a learning rate benchmarking and tuning tool,\nwhich can effectively identify good learning rate policies and\nsupport LLM fine-tuning. Third, our experimental evaluation\nusing LRBench++ on both traditional DNN training and\nLLM fine-tuning demonstrates the pressing need to investigate\nlearning rate tuning in the era of LLMs and validates our\nanalysis. We conjecture that this study will inspire in-depth\nunderstanding and provide practical guidelines toward efficient\nDNN/LLM training and fine-tuning.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z.-Q. Zhao, P. Zheng, S.-t.

R ELATED WORK\nWe below summarize related studies from three main per-\nspectives, (1) learning rate tuning, (2) hyperparameter tuning,\nand (3) Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning.\nLearning Rate Tuning. The learning rate has been widely\nrecognized as one of the most important hyperparameters\nwith high impacts on traditional DNN training [34]–[41].\nExisting studies can be summarized into three broad categories\nof learning rate policies. (1) Formula-based LR is one of\nthe most popular methods to specify learning rate values\nby using a pre-defined function ( η(t)) of the training itera-\ntions/epochs ( t) [34], [35], [38], [42]. These formula-based\nLRs are summarized by [38], [39] into fixed LR, decaying\nLR, cyclic LR, and composite LR.

(3) Exploration-based LR mod-\nels learning rate tuning with Reinforcement Learning [44],\nBayesian optimizations [41], or evolutionary approaches [40],\n[45], to explore the promising search space of learning rates\nand identify good values in deep learning training.\nHyperparameter Tuning . This thread of efforts aims to\nprovide a general-purpose hyperparameter tuning framework,\nsuch as Ray Tune [30], Hyperopt [46], SMAC [47] and\nOptuna [28], by using various tuning strategies, such meta\nmodeling [48], bayesian optimization [49], bandit-based ap-\nproach [50], and population-based method [51]. Even though\nlearning rate can be considered as a sub-problem of hy-\nperparameter tuning, existing general-purpose hyperparameter\ntuning frameworks lack dedicated support for learning rate\ntuning, such as tuning various decaying/cyclic LRs or even\ncomposite LRs [39].\nLarge Language Model (LLM) Fine-tuning. Fine-tuning\nLLMs is an efficient and practical method to adapt a pre-\ntrained LLM to a new learning task, which requires much\nlower training costs and less data compared to training LLMs\nfrom scratch [22]–[24]. Alpaca [22], Koala [24], and Vi-\ncuna [23] are representative fine-tuned LLMs based on the\npublic release of LLaMA [9], which exhibit improved conver-\nsational abilities. [23] also introduces two LLM benchmarks,Chatbot Arena, which is a rating system to rank LLMs based\non crowdsourced user votes, and MT-bench, which leverages\nanother LLM as a judge to evaluate the performance of LLMs.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to\nexplore learning rate tuning for LLMs.\nIII. P ROBLEM STATEMENT\nThe LLM fine-tuning is a process that optimizes a pre-\ntrained LLM to improve the predictive performance on a\nnew dataset and/or a new learning task. Figure 1 shows the\nworkflow of LLM fine-tuning. First, we need to choose a pre-\ntrained LLM to initiate fine-tuning, like LLaMA [9] or Falcon\n[52], and prepare the fine-tuning data, which contains the do-\nmain knowledge for a new application or a new learning task,\nsuch as customer service materials for LLM-powered customer\nservices and meeting summaries for meeting summary gen-\neration using LLMs [21], [53]–[55]. Second, the pre-trained\nLLM will be fine-tuned to achieve enhanced performance and\ndeployed to support this new application or new learning task.\nThird, once deployed, these fine-tuned LLMs can generate\nnew data, which can be filtered and cleaned to continuously\nimprove LLM performance.\nFig. 1. The LLM Fine-tuning Workflow\nThe LLM fine-tuning process involves multiple steps to\nleverage a loss function ( L), an optimizer ( O), and a learning\nrate policy ( η(t)) to iteratively optimize pre-trained LLMs.\nFirst, the LLM will perform inference on an input batch\nof fine-tuning data to generate predictions. Second, the loss\nfunction will be leveraged to compute the LLM gradients\nbased on the difference between the prediction and ground\ntruth. Third, the optimizer and learning rate policy will jointly\nupdate LLMs by controlling the gradients applied to the model\nparameters. For example, Adam [27] is a popular optimizer\nfor LLM fine-tuning [22]–[24], which follows Formula (1) to\nperform model parameter updates.\nMt=β1Mt−1+ (1−β1)∇L, ˆMt=Mt\n1−βt\n1\nVt=β2Vt−1+ (1−β2)(∇L)2,ˆVt=Vt\n1−βt\n2\nΘt+1= Θ t−η(t)ˆMtpˆVi+ϵ(1)\nwhere ∇Lis the gradients calculated for the current iteration,\nˆMtandˆVtare exponential moving averages of gradient and\nsquared gradient, β1andβ2are the two coefficients to control\nthe impacts of the previously accumulated gradients and square']","The context discusses the challenges and opportunities in learning rate (LR) tuning for LLM fine-tuning, particularly emphasizing the high computational costs and the need for cost-effective LR tuning strategies. LRBench++ is presented as a tool that can effectively identify good learning rate policies and support LLM fine-tuning, which aligns with the need for budget-friendly accuracy. This intersection suggests that LRBench++ can help address the challenge of finding efficient LR policies within a given budget, thereby improving model accuracy cost-effectively.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '2309.08859v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.08859v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 3125516, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2309.08859v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.08859v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 3125516, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

"How do LLMs' limits with ""every"" and ""never"" affect their instruction-following?","['2 Context\nOur results are particularly relevant to downstream\ntasks that require an agent to not only create ﬂuent,\ncreative and contextually relevant speech but also\nto act precisely based on the meaning of linguistic\nexpressions and reliably recognize semantic incon-\nsistency.

This in turn suggests that approaches\nwhich attempt to patch up knowledge deﬁciencies\nfor LLMs by giving them access to external mod-\nels (Mialon et al. ,2023 ) will fall short in devel-\noping reliable models of linguistic understanding\nbecause LLMs fail to grasp the notions that under-\nlie the very way that sentences (and actions) are\nwoven together in conversation.\nEmpirical studies like Chaturvedi et al.

The for-\nmer involves masking certain words in a given\ncorpus and training the model to guess the miss-ing words, while in the latter, a context (a sen-\ntence typically) is provided to the model, which\nis trained to predict the sentence that follows. This\nunsupervised training allows language models to\nbuild rich internal representations that have been\nshown through probing to contain at least implic-\nitly a large amount of linguistic information ( De-\nvlin et al. ,2019 ;Liu et al. ,2019 ;Tenney et al. ,\n2018 ).\nFormally, LLMs learn a function f:C×X→\n[0,1]that assigns a probability to a word (or string\nor discourse move) x∈Xgiven a context (or ﬁ-\nnite string) C. More abstractly, let Vbe a count-\nable set called the vocabulary.

Typ-\nically, the prediction function is used on strings of\nlengthmwheremis smaller than n.\nBy exploiting f, an LLM can extend µto a\ndistribution on the set of strings V∗. The most\nstraightforward way is to follow autoregressive\nmodels that calculate the probability of strings\nvia conditionalization. For a new sentence s′=\n(w1,w2,...,wm+1), and an input string sof length\nn provided as context, we have:\nµn+m+1(s′|s) =µn+1(w1|s)×µn+2(w2|s,w1)×\n(1)\n...×µn+m(wn|s,wm−1,...,w1)\nFor anys′∈V∗, µ(s′)represents the conﬁdence\nwith which an LLM predicts s′, after training on\nstrings in V≤n.\n3.2 Linguistic meaning\nIn what follows, we are in interested strings that\nhave a well formed meaning and are evaluable as\ntrue or false.

More\ngenerally, we show that LLMs are unable to\nlearn concepts beyond the ﬁrst level of the\nBorel Hierarchy, which imposes severe limits\non the ability of LMs, both large and small,\nto capture many aspects of linguistic meaning.\nThis means that LLMs will continue to operate\nwithout formal guarantees on tasks that require\nentailments and deep linguistic understanding.\n1 Introduction\nThe success of large language models (LLMs) has\nled researchers in NLP to harness LLMs trained\non vast amounts of data to solve a variety of lan-\nguage understanding and generation tasks, and\nsome have claimed that LLMs can solve any task\nthat can be speciﬁed via prompting ( Brown et al. ,\n2020 ). While the list of LLM successes is long,\nthere have been several recent papers that pro-\nvide empirical evidence that LLMs at least some-\ntimes fail to capture important aspects of linguis-\ntic meaning ( Kuhnle and Copestake ,2019 ;Sinha\net al. ,2020 ;Yuksekgonul et al. ,2022 ;Chaturvedi\net al. ,2022 ;Kalouli et al. ,2022 ). Those who have\ndabbled in “BERTology” with respect to linguis-\ntic meaning often have the feeling that ﬁxing one\nLLM deﬁciency just leads to the discovery of new\nones.This paper provides a theoretical explanation of\ncertain of these observed failings of LLMs. In\nparticular, we prove that LLMs cannot learn the\nnotions of semantic entailment or consistency as\ndeﬁned in formal semantics ( Dowty et al. ,1981 )\nbecause they are incapable of mastering universal\nquantiﬁcation. Our work builds on Siegelmann\nand Sontag (1992 );Siegelmann (2012 );Weiss\net al. (2018 ), concerning the expressive power of\nneural networks, but we focus on the learnability\nof semantic concepts and use novel tools.\nOur argument has widespread implications: not\nonly does a general capacity to recognize seman-\ntic entailment and consistency underlie everyday\nconversational interactions, but the meanings of a\ngreat many common linguistic expressions depend\non universal quantiﬁcation. This set includes—but\nis certainly not limited to—a long list of quanti-\nﬁers ( every, some, many, most,... every other , ...),\ntemporal adverbs ( always, never, eventually ) that\nare essential to planning ( Lamport ,1980 ), modal\noperators ( possibly ,necessarily ,...), and certain\ndiscourse connectives and adverbs ( therefore ,if /\nthen,except ,because , ...).\nWe begin in Section 2by contextualizing our\nclaims in terms of expectations about the linguis-\ntic capacities and applications of LLMs. In Sec-\ntion 3, we introduce the framework of continua-\ntion semantics, which will allow us to adapt cer-\ntain notions central to truth-conditional semantics\nto the case of LLMs. Section 4lays out the core of\nour theoretical argument, focusing ﬁrst on what is\nneeded to learn universal quantiﬁcation and then\ngeneralizing our argument to a wide range of lin-\nguistic expressions. Our theoretical argument sug-\ngests that we should expect certain empirical fail-\nures from LLMs, and in Section 5, we provide ev-\nidence that our predictions are borne out.

Besides,\nto accommodate the structure of AST graphs, GraphCode-\nBERT employs graph-guided masked attention.\n3.1.2 Encoder-decoder LLMs\nEncoder-decoder LLMs refer to a class of LLMs that utilize\nboth the encoder and decoder parts of the Transformer\narchitecture, working in tandem to transform one sequence\ninto another. In particular, the encoder takes the input\nsequence and compresses its information into a fixed-size\nhidden state, which can capture the essence or meaning of\nthe input sequence, while the decoder takes the hidden state\nand produces the corresponding output sequence, step by\nstep, often using attention mechanisms to refer back to parts\nof the input sequence as needed. Thus, this architecture is\nparticularly suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks in NLP\nand SE, where the input and output sequences can be of dif-\nferent lengths and structures, such as code summarization\nand program repair.\nAmong existing encoder-decoder LLMs, T5 (the Text-\nto-Text Transfer Transformer) is a significant development\nin the NLP field and serves as a catalyst for follow-up\nworks, such as CodeT5 and UniXCoder. In the following,\nwe summarize some representative code-related encoder-\ndecoder LLMs.\nPYMT5: First Attempt of Encoder-decoder LLM. Sim-\nilar to CuBERT [26] in the encoder-only LLM domain, as\nearly as 2020, PYMT5 [29] is the first attempt to apply\nencoder-decoder LLMs to source code by replicating the\npre-training process of T5 on a code corpus. PYMT5 is pre-\ntrained with a similar span masking objective from T5 on\n26 million Python code snippets and built on an encode-\ndecoder Transformer with 374 million parameters. PYMT5\nis fine-tuned with two tasks, i.e.,method and comment gen-\neration, demonstrating superior performance against GPT-2.\nT5-Learning: Adaption of T5 for Source Code. In\nparallel with PYMT5 [29], Mastropaolo et al. [30] propose\nT5-learning, to empirically investigate how the T5 model\nperforms when pre-trained and fine-tuned to support code-\nrelated tasks. T5-learning is first pre-trained in a self-\nsupervised way from T5 on CodeSearchNet with both nat-\nural language text and programming language code, i.e.,\nmasking tokens in code and asking the model to guess the\nmasked tokens. T5-learning is then fine-tuned to support\nfour downstream tasks, i.e.,program repair, mutant injec-\ntion, assertion generation, and code summarization. The\nresults demonstrate that T5-learning outperforms previous\nbaselines, showcasing the potential of T5 in code-related\ntasks.\nPLBART: BART-based LLM for Code. Unlike\nPYMT5 [29] only focusing on Python code generation,\nin 2021, Ahmad et al. [31] propose PLBART, an encoder-\ndecoder LLM capable of performing a broad spectrum\nof code understanding and generation tasks. PLABRT is\npre-trained with the denoising objective and built on the\nBART architecture. During the pre-training, PLABRT learns\nto reconstruct an original text that is corrupted using an\narbitrary noise function, including three noise strategies\nin this work, i.e., token masking, token deletion, and to-\nken infilling. PLBART is fine-tuned for two categories of\nfour downstream tasks ( i.e., code generation, translation,summarization, and classification) across seven program-\nming languages. The experimental results demonstrate that\nPLBART outperforms previous LLMs, such as CodeBERT\nand GraphCodeBERT, demonstrating its promise in both\ncode understanding and generation.\nCodeT5: Code-aware T5-based LLM. Despite introduc-\ning source code, PLBART simply processes code snippets as\nnatural language and ignores the code-specific characteris-\ntics. CodeT5 [8] represents a successful adaption of encoder-\ndecoder LLMs from NLP to the source code domain and\nhas been widely used in SE research. In 2021, Wang et al. [9]\nintroduce CodeT5, a unified encoder-decoder LLM based\non the T5 architecture by leveraging the code semantics\nfrom the developer-assigned identifiers. CodeT5 considers\ntwo types of input representations based on whether a\ncode snippet has a corresponding NL description: unimodal\n(i.e., PL) and bimodal ( i.e., PL-NL pairs) data. To encode\nthe input data, CodeT5 concatenates PL and NL into a\nwhole sequence Xwith a delimiter token [SEP ],i.e.,X=\n(w1,···, wn,[SEP ], c1,···, cm,[SEP ]]), where nandm\ndenote the number of NL word tokens and PL code tokens,\nrespectively. CodeT5 employs three identifier-aware pre-\ntraining tasks ( i.e.,masked span prediction, masked identi-\nfier prediction, and identifier tagging) to consider the crucial\ntoken type information and a bimodal dual generation pre-\ntraining task to learn a better NL-PL alignment between the\ncode and its accompanying comment. CodeT5 is then fine-\ntuned with the CodeXGLUE benchmark to perform both\ncode generation and understanding tasks, i.e.,code summa-\nrization, code generation, code translation, code refinement,\ndefect detection, and clone detection. The results demon-\nstrate that CodeT5 significantly outperforms previous LLMs\nin most downstream tasks, such as RoBERTa, CodeBERT,\nGraphCodeBERT, GPT2, CodeGPT, and PLBART.\nSPT-Code. However, previous LLMs simply reuse\nthe pre-training tasks designed for NL, while failing\nto learn the the connection between a piece of code\nand the associated NL for code-related tasks. In May\n2022, Niu et al. [33] introduce SPT-Code, which is a\nsequence-to-sequence LLM designed for source code. When\ngiven a complete method, SPT-Code aims to acquire\ngeneral knowledge from the method’s source code, its\nunderlying code structure, and the corresponding nat-\nural language description. The input is represented as\n{c1,···, cl,[SEP ], a1,···, am,[SEP ], n1,···, np}, where l\nrepresents the number of code tokens, mdenotes the length\nof the linearized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) sequence, and\npsignifies the number of tokens in the natural language\ndescription. SPT-Code introduces three specialized code-\nspecific pre-training tasks, i.e.,Code-AST Prediction (CAP),\nMasked Sequence to Sequence (MASS), and Method Name\nGeneration (MNG). Each of these tasks enables SPT-Code\nto capture a distinct aspect of the data instance. Specifically,\nCAP focuses on understanding the source code by masking\na random fragment of the code tokens. MNG aims to predict\nwhether a given AST accurately represents a particular\ncode fragment, thereby gaining insights into the syntactic\nstructure. Finally, MNG’s objective is to generate subtokens\ncorresponding to the method name, a concise natural lan-\nguage description of the method.

Brackets after technique names\nindicate graph types. D, U, M and E represent directed, undirected, homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, respectively.\namplify the capacity of LLMs in both logical reasoning\nand collaboration within multi-agent systems1,2,7,9. For\ninstance, using a straightforward prompt like ""Let’s\nthink step by step"", commonly referred to as the chain-\nof-thoughts, has been proven to markedly enhance the\nLLM’s proficiency in resolving mathematical problems4.\nIt’s noteworthy that such enhancements are observed\neven with the use of a chain, which represents one\nof the simplest graph structures. This gives rise to\nthe anticipation that leveraging more intricate graph\nstructures could usher in even more profound im-\nprovements. From a broader viewpoint, in multi-agent\nsystems, graphs model inter-agent relationships, facil-\nitating efficient information flow and collaboration.\nLLMs Enhance Graph Learning\nOne pivotal approach to integrating LLMs and graphs\ninvolves leveraging LLMs to bolster graph learning.\nAs illustrated in the left part of Figure 1, this en-\nhancement can materialise through three distinct path-\nways: augmenting conventional graph algorithms with\nthe prowess of LLMs; directly employing LLMs for\ndownstream graph-related tasks; and utilizing LLMs in\nthe intricate construction of graph structures. In the\nfollowing sections, we dissect each of these strategies\nin detail.\nLLMs Augmenting Graph Algorithms\nThe integration of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith graph algorithms primarily seeks to harness LLMs\nas attribute-enhancement mechanisms, elevating the\nintrinsic attributes of graph nodes. As depicted in\nFigure 1(a), LLMs process text information for nodesto produce refined attributes. These enhanced at-\ntributes can potentially improve the performance of\ngraph learning models such as graph neural networks\n(GNNs).\nA direct approach is to employ LLMs as encoders\nfor processing node text-based attributes, with the\noption to fine-tune on specific downstream tasks3.\nAnother technique uses a proprietary LLM, GPT -3.5, to\nsimultaneously produce predictions and explanations\nfor tasks like paper classification5. Using another open-\nsource LLM, they derive node embeddings by encod-\ning both the output of LLMs and the original attributes.\nThese embeddings are combined and then integrated\ninto GNNs to boost performance.\nA more sophisticated approach uses an iterative\nmethod to harmoniously integrate both GNNs and\nLLMs capabilities3. They are initially trained sepa-\nrately; then, via a variational EM framework, the LLM\nuses text and GNN’s pseudo labels, while the GNN\nutilizes LLM-encoded embeddings or node attributes\nand LLMs’ pseudo labels, iteratively boosting mutual\nperformance.\nLLMs Predicting Graph Tasks\nLLMs are adept at predicting graph properties, includ-\ning attributes like node degrees and connectivity, and\ncan even tackle complex challenges such as node and\ngraph classification, as illustrated in Figure 1(b).\nA straightforward application involves presenting\nLLMs with zero-shot or few-shot prompts, prompting\nthem to either directly predict an outcome or to first\nprovide an analytical rationale followed by the ulti-\nmate prediction3,6. Experiments reveal that while LLMs\ndemonstrate a foundational grasp of graph structures,\n2 Integrating Graphs with Large Language Models: Methods and Prospects Oct 2023', 'THEME/FEATURE/DEPARTMENT\ntheir performance lags behind that of graph neural net-\nwork benchmarks. They also show that performance of\nLLMs is significantly affected by the prompting strategy\nand the use of graph description language, which is a\ntextual way to describe graphs.\nA more advanced method, dubbed InstructGLM,\nhas been put forth8. This strategy utilises a multi-\ntask, multi-prompt instructional tuning process to refine\nLLMs prior to inference on specific tasks. During fine-\ntuning, nodes are treated as new tokens—initialised\nwith inherent node features—to broaden the original\nvocabulary of LLMs. Consequently, node embeddings\ncan be refined during the training phase. Employing\nthis refined methodology, their system outperforms\ngraph neural network benchmarks across three citation\nnetworks.\nLLMs Constructing Graphs\nLLMs can help in building graphs for downstream\ntasks as shown in Figure 1(c). For instance, some\nresearchers have tried using LLMs to analyse news\nheadlines and identify companies that might be\nimpacted10. In specific, a network of companies that\nhave correlations is constructed by LLMs automati-\ncally. The generated network can be used to improve\nthe performance of predictions of stock market move-\nments.\nGraphs Enhance LLM Ability\nLeveraging graph structures can significantly boost the\nreasoning and collaborative capacities of LLMs. As\nshown in the right part of Figure 1, these improvements\nemerge via two primary mechanisms: (1) employing\ngraph structures to bolster logical reasoning in LLMs,\nand (2) utilizing graph structures to enhance LLM\ncollaboration in multi-agent systems. We delve deeper\ninto each of these approaches in the subsequent sec-\ntions.\nGraphs Improving LLMs Reasoning\nGraphs are the foundational structure of human rea-\nsoning. Through tools like mind maps and flowcharts,\nand strategies like trial and error or task decomposi-\ntion, we manifest our intrinsic graph-structured thought\nprocesses. Not surprisingly, when properly leveraged,\nthey can significantly elevate the reasoning capabilities\nof LLMs. As illustrated in Figure 1(d1), when tasked,\nLLMs follow a sequence: they process the input data,\nengage in reasoning, and then produce the final re-\nsults. Figure 1(d2) highlights the limitations of LLMs us-\ning “Input-output Prompting”; without reasoning, theirperformance tends to suffer, especially with complex\ntasks.\nEmploying graph structures, from basic chains and\ntrees to more complex designs, can profoundly aug-\nment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Consider the\n“chain-of-thought prompting” (COT) method, depicted\nin Figure 1(d3)4. In this, LLMs harness a chain, a\ntype of directed acyclic graph, for structured problem-\nsolving. Remarkably, even this basic framework triples\nLLMs’ efficacy on GSM8K, a math word problem\nbenchmark.\nIn contrast, the “Tree of Thoughts” (ToT) method,\nutilising trees—an elementary undirected acyclic\ngraph—delves deeper into reasoning. Eeach reason-\ning phase in ToT is a node7. LLMs traverse this\ntree, eliminating non-compliant nodes and returning\nupwards as necessary, to deduce the solution. With\nthis methodology, LLMs notch up a 74% accuracy in\nthe “Game of 24” test, overshadowing the 4% from\nCOT7.\nDiving into intricate graph structures propels LLMs’\ncapabilities even further. Improving ToT, the “Graph\nof Thoughts” (GoT) paradigm has been introduced1,2,\nas illustrated in Figure 1(d5). This advanced rea-\nsoning graph can be heterogeneous, with diverse\nnodes dedicated to specific tasks. Sophisticated mech-\nanisms, such as node aggregation and combination\n(A&C), and dynamic interactions between paths and\ngraphs, are incorporated. A&C, for instance, facilitates\nnode subdivision for task decomposition and node\namalgamation1. Path interactions offer LLMs greater\nflexibility by enabling cross-path traversals, a leap from\nToT’s isolated branch framework. Multi-graph interac-\ntions can even be orchestrated for intricate tasks2.\nThese GoT methodologies dramatically outpace sim-\npler graph models in handling complex challenges,\nindicating that more intricate graph structures could\nusher in even more significant enhancements.\nGraphs Building LLMs Collaboration\nWhile the preceding section examined the capabilities\nof individual LLMs, complex tasks, such as software\ndevelopment, require multiple LLMs to work in tandem\nwithin a collaborative framework, i.e., multi-agent sys-\ntems, as illustrated in Figure 1(e). Graph structures can\nbe instrumental in this context. As depicted in the same\nfigure, these structures can effectively model the rela-\ntionships and information flow between collaborating\nLLMs.\nOct 2023 Integrating Graphs with Large Language Models: Methods and Prospects 3']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2310.05499v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.05499v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1082070, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2310.05499v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.05499v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1082070, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How does normalizing surprisal by subword length affect LLMs' quantifier accuracy for typical/atypical words after most/few quantifiers?,"['Previous work has shown that just summing up\nsubword probability results in skewing of probabil-\nity values towards words with shorter length, which\nis why these quantities are normalized by length\n(Brown et al., 2020). In our setting, this means the\ncritical words split into larger number of subwords\nis likely to be assigned lower probability and thus\nhigher suprisal than critical words that are split into\nfewer or no subwords. To normalize the effect of\nsubword length, we propose normalizing the sur-\nprisal values by the subword length of the critical\nword, depicted by N, following previous works\n(Brown et al., 2020). Thus, we define surprisal as\nshown below:\nS(wi)=−1\nNX\n∀vi∈ {wi}logp(vi|w1, . . . , w i−1)\n(2)\nwhere wiis the critical word split into a set of\nN-subwords represented by the set {wi}andviis\na subword that belongs to that set. Surprisal can\nbe understood as a term representing the inverse-\nprobability of occuring of a word in a context. If a\nword has high probablity of occuring in a context,\nit will have low surprisal, whereas if a word has\na low probablity of occuring in a context, it will\nhave high surprisal. In this work, we will use our\ndefinition of surprisal.\n3.2 Quantifier Accuracy\n(Michaelov and Bergen, 2022) define quantifier\naccuracy based on the surprisal values for the crit-\nical word following a quantifier type. The quan-\ntifier accuracy test was motivated by the human\nbrain response experiments done in (Urbach and\nKutas, 2010). The aim of defining quantifier ac-\ncuracy was to measure if language models take\ninto account the meaning of quantifier words when\ncreating the probability distribution over for the\ncritical word. (Michaelov and Bergen, 2022) pro-\nposes that if LLMs take into account the meaning\nof quantifiers in a sentence, then the typical critical\nwords will be predicted with larger probability and\nthus lower surprisal values following a most -type\nquantifier, and the atypical critical word will be\npredicted with larger probability and thus lower\nsurprisal value with a few-type quantifier .\nTo illustrate this, we refer to the examples shown\nin Table 1. For the backbone prompt modified\nby a most -type quantifier - "" Most postmen carry"",\nan LLM is consider accurate if surprisal for theword oilis more than surprisal of the word mail,\nor in other words, p(mail|Most postmen carry )>\np(oil|Most postmen carry ). To succinctly express\nthis, a sentence in the dataset is considered to be\nmost -type accurate if for a most-type quantifier\nmodified backbone phrase (MBP),\nS(typ|MBP )<S(atyp|MBP ) (3)\nSimilarly, for a backbone prompt mod-\nified by a few-type quantifier - "" Few post-\nmen carry"", an LLM is considered ac-\ncurate if p(oil|Few postmen carry ) >\np(mail|Few postmen carry ). This means\nthat the atypical word is more likely to occur\nwith the few-type quantifier. Thus, a sentence is\nconsidered to be few-type accurate for a few-type\nquantifier modified backbone phrase (FBP) if for\nthat phrase,\nS(atyp|FBP )>S(typ|FBP ) (4)\nAs proposed by (Michaelov and Bergen, 2022),\nthemost -type and few-type quantifier accuracy is\nthen calculated as the ratio of sentences following\nthe above equations for the respective quantifiers.\nFigure 1 shows most -type and few-type accuracy\nfor different LLMs as a function of the number of\nparameters in the model. We also see the inverse-\nscaling of few-type quantifier understanding very\nclearly. As shown by the plot, as the number of\nparameters increase, the few-type quantifier com-\nprehension gets worse. Figure 1 is created using\nour normalized definition of surprisal taking into ac-\ncount the subword tokenization, and is thus slightly\ndifferent from the original paper.\n3.2.1 What’s wrong with this way of defining\nquantifier accuracy?\nQuantifier accuracy as defined in equations 3 and 4\nhave a few drawbacks. The first is the assumption\nthattypicality of a word for humans is the same as\nthat for language models. A word deemed ""typical""\nfor a backbone phrase would indeed be in the top\nfew words used by a human, but the same might\nnot be true for language models. To experimentally\nconfirm this, we analyse the output distribution\nof generated words following a backbone phrase.\nWe find that the ""typical"" word in the dataset does\nnot even fall into the top-100 most likely words\nfollowing a backbone phrase for gpt-2 large. This', 'two sets of quantifier and completed by a typical\nand an atypical continuing word. An example can\nbe seen in Table 1.\nThe backbone phrase shown in the example is\n‘postmen carry’, which is modified by a most -type\nand a few-type quantifier. Following (Michaelov\nand Bergen, 2022), in this paper we study the ef-\nfects of these two quantifiers and how LLMs in-\nterpret them. Each backbone phrase is modified\nby two most -type and two few-type modifiers. Af-\nter the quantifiers are used to modify the back-\nbone phrases, if the language model takes into ac-\ncount the meaning of the word, it should be more\nlikely to produce a word with appropriate typicality.\nWords that are more typically associated with the\nbackbone phrase are labelled typical (T) . For exam-\nples, the phrase ""postmen carry"" is typically fol-\nlowed by the word mail and not by the atypical (A)\nword oil.We expect the language model to take\ninto account the quantifier when assigning prob-\nabilities to the word following the quantifier-\nmodified phrase . Each backbone phrase modified\nby a quantifier is tested to be followed by a typical\nand an atypical word. The typical/atypical words\nare also together referred to as critical words in\nthis paper.\nThe dataset contains a total of 960 sentences,\nwith 120 unique backbone phrases, with 8 modifi-\ncations to each sentence as shown in Table 1. We\nhave 2 different quantifier types and two quantifiers\nper quantifier type, thus making four versions of\neach backbone phrase. Each quantifier-modified\nbackbone phrase is followed by a typical and atyp-\nical word, thus making 8 sentences per backbone\nphrase.\nThese sentences were used to measure human\nbrain response to critical words in association with\nthe quantifier used (Urbach and Kutas, 2010). It\nwas found that humans brain signals produce a\nspike when an atypical critical word is used with\nthemost -type quantifier. This spike in brain acti-\nvation (called N400 signals) are associated with\nunexpected events. Hence, these N400 spikes show\nthat the atypical critical words when following a\nmost -type quantifier were unexpected/incorrect. A\nlower activation is seen when the most -type quan-\ntifier is followed by a typical critical word. This\nspike in the N400 signal can be explained by a\nquantity called surprisal , which is the negative\nlog-probability of the occurence of a word in that\ncontext. This means the less likely the word, thehigher the surprisal.

We use the GPT2\nmodel family (125M-1.5B parameters) (Radford\net al., 2019), ElutherAI’s GPT models (GPT-Neo\n125M, GPT-Neo 1.3B, GPT-Neo 2.7B and GPT-J\n6B) (Black et al., 2022), the OPT model family\n(125M - 13B parameters), the GPT-3 model family\n(2B-175B parameters) and the InstructGPT model\nfamily (Ouyang et al., 2022) called GPT3.5 in the\nrest of the paper (2B-175B parameters).\n3 Quantifier Comprehension in LLMs\nIn this section, we first present how (Michaelov\nand Bergen, 2022) measure quantifier comprehen-\nsion in LLMs. Specifically, we present two ideas\nofsurprisal andquantifier accuracy and ways to\nmeasure both properties as proposed by (Michaelov\nand Bergen, 2022). Alongside, we also highlight\nshortcomings of these quantifier comprehension\nevaluation methods.\n3.1 Surprisal\nAs defined in section 2, surprisal is the negative\nlog-probability of occurrence of a word given a\ncontext, as show below:\nSp(wi)=−logp(wi|w1, . . . , w i−1) (1)\nwhere wiis the critical word under observation\nandw1, . . . , w i−1are the words preceding the crit-\nical word in a sentence. The underscore pin the\nsurprisal represents that this is the definition of sur-\nprisal in prior work. (Michaelov and Bergen, 2022)\nacknowledge that words in language models are\nusually split into subwords. For scenarios when\nthis happens for a critical word, (Michaelov and\nBergen, 2022) suggest to sum up the suprisals of\neach individual subwords. This essentially means\nmultiplying the probabilities of each subword that\nmakes up the critical word. The use of this defini-\ntion of surprisal is suboptimal as it does not take\ninto account the effects of subword tokenization.']",nan,multi_context,"[{'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2306.07384v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2306.07384v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1364856, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2306.07384v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2306.07384v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1364856, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

"How do LLM model audits aid redesign, inform API licenses, address governance, and evaluate performance?","['specific applications. However, model audits do not focus on organisational procedures but on LLMs’ capabilities\nand characteristics. Specifically, they should identify an LLM’s limitations to (i) inform the continuous redesign the\nsystem, and (ii) communicate its capabilities and limitations to external stakeholders. These two tasks use similar\nmethodologies, but they target different audiences.\nThe first task – limitation identification – aims primarily to support organisations that develop LLMs with bench-\nmarks or other data points that inform internal model redesigning and retraining efforts [182]. Model audits’ results\nshould also inform API license agreements, helping prevent applications in unintended use cases [176] and restricting\nthe distribution of dangerous capabilities [76]. The second task – communicating capabilities and limitations – aims to\ninform the design of specific applications built on top of LLMs by downstream developers. Such communication can\ntake different forms, e.g., interactive model cards [183] and information about the initial training dataset [184], [185],\nto help downstream developers adapt the model appropriately.\nIn Sec. 3, we argued that the way technology audits are being conducted requires modifications to address the\ngovernance challenges associated with LLMs (Claim 5). In what follows, we demonstrate that evaluating an LLM’s\ncharacteristics independent of an intended use case is challenging but not impossible.21To do so, auditors can use two\ndistinct approaches. The first involves identifying and assessing intrinsic characteristics. For example, the training\ndataset can be assessed for completeness and consistency without reference to specific use cases [120]. However, it\nis often expensive and technically challenging to interrogate large datasets [186]. The second involves employing an\nindirect approach that tests the model across multiple potential downstream use cases, links the results to different\ncharacteristics, and assesses the aggregated results using different weighting techniques. That second approach may\nprove more fruitful when assessing an LLM’s performance.\nNevertheless, selecting the characteristics to focus on during model audits remains challenging. Given such audits’\npurpose, we recommend examining characteristics that are:\n•Socially and ethically relevant , i.e., that can be directly linked to the social and ethical risks posed by LLMs;\n•Predictably transferable , i.e., that impact the nature of downstream applications; and\n•Meaningfully operationalisable , i.e., that can be assessed with the available tools and methods.\nKeeping those criteria in mind, we posit that model audits should focus on (at least) the performance, robustness,\ninformation security and truthfulness of LLMs. As other characteristics may meet the three criteria listed above, those\nfour characteristics are just examples highlighting the role of model audits in our three-layered approach. The list of\nrelevant model characteristics can be amended as required when developing specific auditing procedures.\nWith those caveats out of the way, we now proceed to discuss how four example characteristics can be assessed\nduring model audits:\n1.Performance, i.e., how well the LLM functions on various tasks. Standardised benchmarks can help assess\nan LLM’s performance by comparing it to a human baseline. For example, GLUE [187] aggregates LLM\nperformance across multiple tasks into a single reportable metric. Such benchmarks have been criticised for\noverestimating performance over a narrow set of capabilities and quickly becoming saturated, i.e., rapidly\nconverging on the performance of non-expert humans, leaving limited space for valuable comparisons.\nTherefore, it is crucial to evaluate LLMs’ performance against many tasks or benchmarks, and sophisticated\ntools and methods have been proposed for that purpose, including SuperGLUE [60], which is more challenging\nand ‘harder to game’ with narrow LLM capabilities, and BIG-bench [72], which can assess LLM’s performance\non tasks that appear beyond their current capabilities. These benchmarks are particularly relevant for model\naudits because they were primarily developed to evaluate pre-trained models, without task-specific fine-tuning.\n2.Robustness, i.e., how well the model reacts to unexpected prompts or edge cases. In ML, robustness indicates\nhow well an algorithm performs when faced with new, potentially unexpected (i.e., out-of-domain) input\ndata. LLMs lacking robustness introduce, at least, two distinct risks [188]. First, the risk of critical system\nfailures if, for example, an LLM performs poorly for individuals, unlike those represented in the training data\n[189]. Second, the risk of adversarial attacks [190], [191]. Therefore, researchers and developers have created\ntools and methods to assess LLMs’ robustness, including evaluation toolkits like the Robustness Gym [192],\nbenchmark datasets like ANLI [193], and open-source platforms like Dynabench [194]. Particularly relevant\nfor our purposes is AdvGLUE [195], which evaluates LLMs’ vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks in different\ndomains using a multi-task benchmark. By quantifying robustness, AdvGLUE facilitates comparisons between\nLLMs and their various affordances and limitations. However, robustness can be operationalised in different\n21A wide range of tools and methods to evaluate LLMs already exists.

How does EcoAssistant's hierarchy and solution demo boost cost-efficiency and performance in code queries?,"['Preprint\nand accurately. EcoAssistant doesn’t need any offline preparation or training; it is a purely\nonline service that improves with use. It contains three fundamental components. First, to support\niterative coding, it allows the conversational LLM as an assistant agent to converse with an automatic\ncode executor and iteratively refine code to make the correct API calls. We build EcoAssistant\nusing AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), a recent framework that enables building LLM applications via\nmulti-agent conversation. Unlike existing practices that use LLMs to produce code or answer the\nuser query in a single generation, our system design exploits the recent advance of conversational\nLLMs that can iteratively refine their outputs (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023).\nSecond, we employ a hierarchy of LLM assistants, referred to as assistant hierarchy, which attempts to\nanswer the query with weaker, cheaper LLMs before backing off to stronger, expensive ones. For each\nquery, we start the conversation with the most cost-effective LLM assistant, and progressively back\noff to more expensive ones only when the current one fails. As LLMs typically have heterogeneous\npricing structures, such a simple strategy could reduce the overall cost of the system by reducing the\nusage of expensive LLMs.\nThird, we propose solution demonstration, which retrieves solutions from past successful queries as\nin-context demonstrations to help subsequent queries. To achieve this, we store correct query-code\npairs in a database once a query succeeds; then when a new query enters, we retrieve the most similar\nquery as well as the associated code from the database as in-context demonstrations in the LLM’s\nprompt. With the proven solutions demonstrated, the assistant is more likely to generate accurate and\nefficient responses without redundant iterations, thereby increasing the likelihood of success.\nAlthough the assistant hierarchy and solution demonstration offer distinct advantages when used\nindividually, we find that their interplay leads to a synergistic effect that amplifies their individual\nbenefits. This is, because the assistants in the hierarchy share the database storing query-code pairs,\nthese solutions from stronger, expensive LLMs serve as useful guidance for the weaker models on\nsubsequent queries. As a consequence, the weaker assistant is likely to solve more queries in the\nfuture, which further reduces the systems’ reliance on expensive LLMs.\nWe conduct systematic experiments on various types of queries to investigate both the performance\nand the dollar cost of the proposed system. Our results highlight that the assistant hierarchy can sig-\nnificantly reduce the cost, while the solution demonstration largely boosts the system’s performance.\nIn addition, EcoAssistant , which incorporates both of these strategies, achieves superior perfor-\nmance with a further reduction of the cost. In addition, we show that EcoAssistant outperforms\nan individual GPT-4 assistant with a margin of 10% success rate with less than half of the expense.\n2 T HE TASK OF CODE -DRIVEN QUESTION ANSWERING\nIn this work, we focus on a practical yet challenging task called code-driven question answering ,\nwhere LLMs have to answer knowledge queries; The LLM has to generate code to invoke APIs for\nacquiring the necessary information needed to answer the user’s question. For example, a user query\ncould be asking for dynamic or real-time information like the weather of a specific location at a certain\ndate. Since this information is not stored in the model’s internal knowledge or general knowledge\nbase, the model would rely on the weather APIs to acquire the information. To achieve this, LLMs\nneed to not only understand the user’s query correctly but also write decent Python code. Thus, this\nnew task presents a multi-faceted challenge: it demands proficiency in language understanding and\ngeneration of both natural and programming language. This characteristic differentiates code-driven\nquestion answering from existing question answering paradigms such as open-domain question\nanswering (Lee et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017) or browser-assistant question answering (Nakano\net al., 2021), since they typically do not challenge the LLMs’ capability of generating and refining\ncode. It is also different from generic code generation task (Chen et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021;\nAustin et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023) by requiring LLMs to exploit domain-specific\nAPI based on the user query.\nIterative coding. Code-driven question answering naturally requires iterative coding (Yang et al.,\n2023). We connect the underlying LLM attempting to generate the code with a code executor.\nIntuitively, the code executor executes the generated code and forwards either the execution results\nor the failed execution trace back to the LLM. This interaction may occur multiple times, as the\nLLM uses the previous execution trace to refine its generation. One could view this process as an\n2', 'Preprint\nautomatic multi-turn chat between the LLM and the code executor, which happens completely in the\nbackground, without the user’s involvement. We adopt chat LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, allowing\nus to leverage all the recent advancements of LLMs for chat-purposes.\nQueries come streaming. We also consider a real-world scenario where queries come streaming\nsequentially over time. Therefore, each query is not an independent task but could leverage past\nqueries as guidance. In such a setting, one could imagine deriving keeping track of successful queries\nto improve future ones. Our system, described below, investigates how to utilize past queries to better\nserve future ones.\n3EC OAS S I S T A N T :USING LLM ASSISTANT MORE AFFORDABLY AND\nACCURATELY\nTo re-iterate, the task of code-driven question answering is both challenging and expensive. LLMs\nstruggle to generate the correct code at the first attempt to utilize APIs, and handling a high volume of\nuser queries using LLM services with a fee can be cost-intensive. To tackle this task in an affordable\nand accurate manner, we develop EcoAssistant , a system that uses LLMs to answer knowledge\nqueries correctly while reducing dollar costs.\nEcoAssistant contains three components (see Figure 1). First, it places LLMs as an assistant\nagent in conversation with a code executor. The LLM iteratively debugs its code by reading the code\nexecutor’s outputs or failed execution trace, and finally produces the answer based on the information\nobtained. Second, to reduce expenses, we use a hierarchy of LLM assistants, attempting queries with\ncheaper LLM assistants before resorting to more expensive alternatives. Third, we keep track of\nsuccessful queries and the associated code and use them as in-context demonstrations for subsequent\nones. This allows LLMs in the future to use past successes as guidance. Our system requires no\noffline preparation, no dataset curation, and no training.\nFigure 1: EcoAssistant : the system involves two agents, one executor agent for executing the\ncode and the other assistant agent backed by LLMs for suggesting code to obtain information and\naddress the user queries. The query-code database stores the previous successful query and code pair.\nWhen a new query comes, the most similar query in the database is retrieved and then demonstrated in\nthe initial prompt with the associated code. The conversation invokes the most cost-effective assistant\nfirst and tries the more expensive one in the assistant hierarchy only when the current one fails.\nAutomated conversation between LLM assistants and code executor.

How does model unpredictability at T=0 affect initial vs. final predictions in multi-turn chats?,"['9 Limitations\nIn this work, we aim to systematically study model\nbehavior in multi-turn conversation, in particular\nwith respect to the model’s management of a user\nchallenge. Although we designed the experiment\nwith the intent to simplify reproducibility, there\nremain elements that could affect the validity of\nour results.\nFirst, even though we set the generation tem-\nperature to T= 0, some of the models remain\nnon-deterministic in nature. For example, since we\ndo not have access to the weights of the API-based\nmodels and API providers have in the past updated\nmodel weights served under an existing model card.\nThis could influence the reproducibility of results.\nSecond, although we included several tasks and\nchallenger utterances in our experiment, these are\nby no means exhaustive. The addition of other\ntasks or challengers might reveal more nuanced\nfindings. The addition of other open-source mod-\nels (such as Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), XGen\n(Nijkamp et al., 2023), etc.) with known training\nmethodology might also reveal clues on the training\nelements that lead to more pronounced FlipFlop\neffects and sycophancy.\nThird, although the FlipFlop experiment simu-\nlates multi-turn conversations, such conversations\nremain synthetic in nature and do not significantly\ndeviate from one another. It is likely that our find-\nings and their relative importance do not translate\ndirectly in a more natural setting. The aim of\nthe FlipFlop experiment is to provide a simplified\nframework to study and compare LLM behavior,\nbut the generalization of model behavior in free-\nform conversations should be approached carefully.\nFourth, we center our evaluation on metrics that\nmeasure performance deterioration and answer flip-\nping. Yet, other aspects of model responses might\nbe of importance depending on the use case. For\ninstance, measuring the relative politeness, con-\nciseness, or consistency of the responses could be\nimportant, but was out-of-scope of our work.\nFifth, we center our experiments on classifica-\ntion tasks, which have straightforward formulations\nand metrics in place to evaluate model response\nsuccess. Yet LLMs are often used in open-domain\ngeneration tasks, and evaluating sycophantic be-\nhavior in such a scenario is important and remains\nunderexplored. For example, future could explore\nhow LLMs navigate summarization tasks in multi-\ndocument scenarios where documents potentiallyprovide discordant views that potentially contra-\ndict each other (Laban et al., 2022), requiring the\nLLM to take a stance or generate nuanced answers\n(Huang et al., 2023b). The evaluation of such sce-\nnarios remains open-ended, and would likely re-\nquire human annotation.\nSixth, we do not conclusively determine the ori-\ngin of sycophantic behavior in LLMs, and although\nwe identify certain elements in the tasks and chal-\nlenger utterances that lead to larger effects (such as\nthe domain of the task, or including an authorita-\ntive persona in the challenger), the results remain\nsolely empirical and do not provide a theoretical\nexplanation for the observed behavior.\nReferences\nYuntao Bai, Saurav Kadavath, Sandipan Kundu,\nAmanda Askell, Jackson Kernion, Andy Jones,\nAnna Chen, Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini,\nCameron McKinnon, et al. 2022.

It centers around refining LLMs re-\nsponses based on the intermediate reasoning steps\n(Wei et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022), feedback of\nprevious model outputs (Madaan et al., 2023; Paul\net al., 2023) or a multi-agent debate (Du et al., 2023;\nLiang et al., 2023). Krishna (2023) study the ability\nof LLMs to self-correct in tasks related to truth-\nfulness and toxicity. Most recently, Huang et al.\n(2023a) critically examines the efficacy of such in-\ntrinsic self-correction methods, finding that LLMs\nstruggle to self-correct without external feedback\nand highlighting the performance deterioration as-\nsociated with such methods.

How does MovieChat's memory mechanism improve long video processing with non-overlap sliding windows and frame token consolidation?,"['as part of its multi-modal approach, with audio inputs currently associated with video instruction\ndata. The model is actively being developed to include a more focused audio instruction dataset.\nLLMV A-GEBC [96]. The LLMV A-GEBC model, designed for Generic Event Boundary Captioning\n(GEBC) [ 166], uniquely combines advanced feature extractors with an LLM for precise video\ncaptioning. It employs CLIP-ViTG [ 167] with Q-former [ 110] and other feature extractors (i.e.,\nCLIP [ 107], Omnivore [ 168], and VinVL [ 169]) to process primary and supplementary visual\nfeatures. The model generates video query tokens enhanced with boundary embeddings and positional\nencodings. For caption generation, it utilizes an LLM, specifically OPT [ 170], to construct and\ninterpret prompts, enabling accurate and contextual captioning of video events. This innovative\napproach has demonstrated notable success in the CVPR 2023 GEBC competition. The model does\nnot support processing sound or speech inputs.\nmPLUG-video [118]. The mPLUG-video model, designed for video understanding tasks, handles\nvideo category classification, video captioning, and video-text retrieval. Its approach to video\nmodeling begins with a TimeSformer-based video encoder to extract features from sparsely sampled\nframes, followed by a visual abstractor module to reduce sequence length. These processed features\nare then input into a frozen, pre-trained Chinese GPT-3 [ 171] as the language decoder. For fine-\ntuning, mPLUG-video leverages the Youku-mPLUG dataset [ 118]. During evaluation, it demonstrates\nsuperior performance in video category classification and video captioning tasks. However, the model\ndoes not support processing sound or speech inputs. mPLUG-video is focused solely on visual and\ntextual elements for video understanding, not supporting audio inputs.\nMovieChat [102]. MovieChat primarily focuses on the processing and understanding of long videos,\nemploying a memory mechanism based on long-short attention to extract information from extensive\nvideo content. MovieChat utilizes a frozen visual module to extract frame information from long\nvideos using non-overlap sliding windows. Frames are sequentially placed into the short-term memory.\nOnce the short-term memory reaches a predetermined length limit, the earliest frame token is popped\nand consolidated into the long-term memory. For processing long-term memory, MovieChat follows\nthe ToMe [ 172] to perform a memory consolidation method, which involves using cosine similarity\nto assess adjacent frames and merging the most similar tokens in the neighboring frames. During\ninference, MovieChat can operate in a global mode, where only information from the long-term\nmemory is fed into the LLMs for reasoning. Alternatively, in breakpoint mode, the information fed\ninto the LLMs includes not only the long-term memory but also the current frame and the information\nfrom the current short-term memory. MovieChat’s visual module utilizes ViT-G/14 from EV A-\nCLIP [ 173], and for LLMs, it employs GPT-3.5 and Claude. Additionally, MovieChat introduces a\nnew dataset, MovieChat-1K, for long video understanding tasks, containing 1K high-quality video\nclips sourced from various movies and TV series, accompanied by 14K manual annotations.\nLLaMA-VQA [103]. LLaMA-VQA is designed for video understanding tasks in VideoQA (Video\nQuestion Answering). LLaMA-VQA addresses linguistic bias in LLMs by predicting combinations\nof video, question, and answer, ensuring balanced consideration of visual content and textual queries.\nThis model is adept at temporal and causal reasoning tasks in videos. For modeling, it flips the\nsource pair and target label within the < V, Q, A > triplet, promoting a deeper understanding of\nthe complex relationships in VideoQA scenarios. The model uses CLIP to encode each frame, and\nthen uses MLPs to map the frame token into the latent space of the LLMs. It has been evaluated on\nfive challenging VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance to both LLM-based and\nnon-LLM models. The model does not support for processing sound or speech inputs in the context\nof this model.\nVideo-LLaV A [104]. The Video-LLaV A excels in various video understanding tasks by unifying vi-\nsual representations of images and videos into a single language feature space before projection. This\napproach enables effective learning of multi-modal interactions, leading to significant performance\nimprovements in video understanding. Specifically, the frozen vision encoder of LanguageBind [ 120]\nis used in the pipeline of encoding visual information, then a projection layer is used to connect\nthe encoder of LanguageBind and LLMs. The model is trained and evaluated on mixed datasets\nof images and videos, demonstrating superior results across benchmarks like MSRVTT, MSVD,\nTGIF [ 174], and ActivityNet. However, the model does not specifically support processing sound or\nspeech inputs, focusing primarily on visual data.\nChat-UniVi [99].

This aims to evaluate how effectively pretrained LLMs can be utilized for reasoning in\ndriving-related tasks, such as action prediction. The Perceiver-BC model includes the identical Vector\nEncoder and V-former modules as those in the LLM agent model. However, it differs in the fact that\nit employs a transformer-based policy module in place of the LLM with adapters (please refer to\nAppendix A for more details). The Perceiver-BC model also outputs actions with perception auxiliary\ntasks of agent and traffic light detection. To maintain an equitable comparison, we’ve calibrated\nthe BC model to have a similar number of trainable parameters as in the LLM agent, totaling to\napproximately 25 million trainable parameters.

How do LLMs' limits with structured data affect molecule prediction vs. ML models for geometric analysis?,"['Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Zhong et al.\nWhile LLMs have showcased their effectiveness across an array of NLP applications, the full extent of their potential\nin broader fields remains largely unexplored [ 46]. Notably, LLMs encounter challenges with structured data like graphs\nand often struggle with domain-specific inquiries, such as those in biology and chemistry [ 3,24]. To fill the gap, this\npaper delves into an essential research question: Can LLMs effectively handle molecule prediction tasks?\nTo answer this research question, this paper identifies different important tasks, including classification and regression\nprediction tasks, across six benchmark molecule datasets [ 22,42],e.g.,ogbg-molbace ,ogbg-molbbbp ,ogbg-molhiv ,\nogbg-molesol ,ogbg-molfreesolv andogbg-mollipo . Take a molecule, as illustrated in Figure 1, as an example, it\ncan be represented in different representations, including SMILES string [41] and geometric structure [46]. However, a\nnotable limitation of the existing LLMs is their reliance on unstructured text, rendering them unable to incorporate\nessential geometric structures as input [ 15,28]. To address this challenge, Fatemi et al . [12] propose encoding the\ngraph structure into text descriptions. In this paper, depicted in Figure 1, we extend this method by encoding both\nthe molecule’s atom features and graph structure into textual descriptions . Subsequently, we carefully design a set\nof prompts to harness various capabilities ( e.g., domain-expertise, ICL capability) of LLMs to generate responses for\nmolecule tasks. Then we evaluate these responses in terms of consistency and performance on downstream tasks and\ncompare them with those generated by existing ML models designed for molecule prediction tasks [19, 47].\nThe outcomes of our study effectively answered the raised question. Firstly, LLMs demonstrate a shortfall in\ncompetitive performance compared to existing ML models, particularly those specifically designed to capture the\ngeometric structure of molecules. While ICL techniques offer notable assistance in improving LLM performance, they\nstill trail behind existing ML models, underscoring the limited capability of current LLMs in directly addressing molecule\ntasks. Secondly, we delve into the potential of integrating LLM responses with existing ML models, observing significant\nenhancements in numerous scenarios.

How do Minions balance high-speed SSM speculation and memory limits during LLM verification while using multiple SSMs to boost token acceptance?,"['Minions introduces an efficient pipeline mechanism. It concur-\nrently executes SSMs and the LLM and effectively overlaps\nthe additional runtime overhead introduced by the speculation\nof SSMs.\nThe key to enabling pipelined execution of SSMs and the\nLLM lies in decoupling their execution processes. To solve\nthis issue, we introduce an intermediate resulting pool . After\ninferencing a batch, SSMs store speculation results in the in-\ntermediate resulting pool , and the LLM accesses the pool for\nverification. Hence, the execution of SSMs is not constrained\nby LLM. And as long as there are available requests in the\nintermediate resulting pool , LLM can sustain continuous exe-\ncution.\nTo ensure efficient execution of the pipeline, a crucial con-\nsideration is the speed of SSM speculation. Avoiding bubbles\nin the LLM execution process is a key factor in achieving\na high throughput pipeline mechanism. Fortunately, due to\nthe large discrepancy in parameter scale between SSM and\nLLM, the execution speed of SSM is faster than that of LLM.\nThis ensures that there are always pending requests in the\nintermediate resulting pool when LLM is ready to execute,\npreventing the occurrence of bubbles in the execution flow.\nNevertheless, this efficiency comes at the cost of introducing\nanother intricate challenge. As shown in Figure7, the high\ninference speed of SSM results in LLM being unable to imme-\ndiately verify the requests SSM generates. Consequently, over\ntime, the intermediate resulting pool accumulates a signifi-\ncant number of pending requests. Once a request is processed,\nthe key and value matrices will be calculated and reside in the\nGPU memory as KVCache. As the LLM inference progresses,\nthe GPU memory is occupied by a large number of KVCache\nfor requests, but only a small portion of these requests are\nactively being executed by LLM. On one hand, this leads to\nfrequent triggering of swapping [13,34] or recomputation [18]\nto ensure memory safety, which results in severe degradation\nof the inference efficiency of LLM. On the other hand, con-\nstrained by this inefficient memory management, the batch\nsize for LLM inference is also limited, thereby impacting the\nthroughput of LLM.\nTo alleviate this issue, we track the intermediate result-\ning pool to restrict the speculation speed of SSMs. Firstly,\nfor LLM, as long as the intermediate resulting pool can ac-\ncommodate requests equivalent to its batch size before each\ninference execution, there will be no bubbles in the pipeline\nprocess. Under this constraint, efforts are made to minimize\nthe accumulation of requests in the pool. To achieve this goal,\nas soon as a round of SSM speculation finishes, we track the\nvolume of the intermediate resulting pool . If the volume is\ngreater than or equal to the batch size of LLM, SSMs pause\ntheir execution. However, once it is observed that the volume\nof the intermediate resulting pool falls below the batch size\nof LLM due to LLM execution, the SSM will execute imme-\ndiately. Due to the higher speed of SSM compared to LLM in\nprocessing an equal number of requests, SSM can generate a\nSSMLLMSSM One Batch Execution\nLLM  One Batch Verification�2=(3×(����−����)\n�2�1=(2×(����−����)\nSSM\n�1SSM LLM\nLLM\n...\nIntermediate Resulting PoolBatch 0\n(B0)\nB1SSM One Batch Output\n�3SSM LLMBatch 1\n(B1)\nBatch 2\n(B2)\nBatch 3\n(B3)\nB3B2\nB2B1SSMBatch 4\n(B4)\nB3B2\nB4...Figure 7: The workflow of the speculative generation pipeline\nand the status of the intermediate resulting pool in the absence\nof any control.

The ideas behind\nMinions are general to be adapted to other LLM inference\nsystems, and we leave such engineering efforts for future\nwork.\nThe vLLM system is built with the assumption that in the\ndecoding stage, there will be one newly generated token that\nties to one KVCache block for each sequence. This assump-\ntion won’t hold anymore for speculative decoding. To address\nthis issue, we extend the paged attention of vLLM to sup-\nport taking more than one token as input when KVCache\nhas already existed. Furthermore, to remove the KVCache\ncorresponding to tokens that failed verification in the LLM,\nwe extend the BlockManager of vLLM. Specifically, during\nLLM execution, for the KVCache of each token, we record\nits logical block ID and offset. After execution, for tokens\nthat failed verification, we delete their corresponding memory\nslots based on the previously recorded logical addresses.\nIn addition, to better align the SSMs with LLM, we fine-\ntune SSMs with distillation technique [12, 41]. Specifically,\nwe prompt LLM with part of the instructions constructed\nfrom Empathetic_Dialogues Datasets [36], Chatbot Instruc-\ntion Prompts Datasets [14], and Finance Alpaca Datasets [15]\nrespectively. We then filter out wrong answers and use the\ncorrect generated instruction data to fine-tune SSMs.\nMoreover, to achieve concurrent inference for SSMs and\nLLM, we utilize NVIDIA MPS [30] which is a practical\ntechnique used by several spatial GPU sharing works [5, 43].\n8', 'the inference. The mechanism enables a larger batch size and\nbetter utilization of GPU resources, further boosting the in-\nference performance of LLM. Minions is implemented based\non the vLLM [18] and can support main-stream LLMs. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Minions by comparing it\nwith cutting-edge LLM inference systems under representa-\ntive LLMs and datasets.\nSpecifically, this paper makes the following contributions:\n•We propose a majority-voted mechanism that leverages\nmultiple SSMs to improve the acceptance rate of specu-\nlative tokens during LLM verification with a low com-\nputation cost for the inference.\n•We propose an adaptive mechanism to determine the\noptimal speculation length of SSMs by efficiently ex-\nploiting the search space composed of different LLM\nconfigurations for better inference performance.\n•We propose a pipelined execution mechanism that de-\ncouples the execution of SSM decoding and LLM ver-\nification to effectively reduce the idle time during the\ninference with improved throughput.\n•Based on the above mechanisms, we implement Minions ,\nan LLM inference system to accelerate the speculative\ngeneration of LLM inference. The experiment results\ndemonstrate that the Minions can achieve shorter latency\nand higher throughput compared to existing systems.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2\ndescribes the background and motivation of this paper. Sec-\ntion 3 presents the details of our proposed method. Section 4\ndescribes the implementation details. Section 5 provides the\nevaluation results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.\nWe discuss the related work in Section 6 and conclude this\npaper in Section 7.\n2 Background and Motivation\nIn this section, we start by introducing speculative decoding\nas the background. We then present important observations\nbased on quantitative experiments to illustrate new opportu-\nnities for accelerating speculative decoding. We use publicly\nreleased LlaMA-160M and OPT-125M as SSMs [25]. The re-\nmaining experimental setup can be referred to in Section 5.1.\n2.1 Speculative Decoding\nThe fundamental idea of speculative decoding is to use a\nsmall speculative model (SSM) to predict several subsequent\ntokens in advance and then feed them into its counterpart,\nthe large language model (LLM) to verify its speculations.\nIf the speculations from SSM are consistent with LLM, the\nLLM accepts these speculative outputs. Since the actual token\ngenerations are carried out with the SSM that is an order ofmagnitude faster than LLM, the more tokens from the SSM\nthat are verified by the LLM, the more it accelerates the LLM\ninference.\nSpecifically, in each iteration, the SSM predicts ssubse-\nquent tokens ( x1,x2,...,xs), and LLM calculates the logit oi(x)\ncorresponding to each token in parallel. When the computa-\ntion from both SSM and LLM is complete, the outputs from\nSSM are verified as follows. For each token, if the logit of\nSSM ( qi(x)) is less or equal to that of LLM ( oi(x)), the token\nwill be accepted. Otherwise, the token will be rejected with\nprobability 1−oi(x)\nqi(x)and sampled again from an adjusted dis-\ntribution of norm (max(0,oi(x)−qi(x))). Once the rejection\noccurs, all tokens after this token will be discarded. There-\nfore, the efficacy of speculative decoding largely depends on\nthe ability of SSM to accurately predict the outputs of LLM.\nMoreover, if every token generated by SSM is accepted, an\nextra token will be sampled using oi+1(x). The above process\nis repeated until the LLM finishes generating all tokens.\n2.2 Model Capability Gap Between SSM and\nLLM\nFigure 1 presents the average acceptance rates of speculative\ndecoding for two pairs of LLM-SSM models under varying\nspeculation lengths across different datasets. The model pair\nOPT-13B-OPT-125M exhibits a superior acceptance rate on\nfinance anddialogue datasets, however performs slightly poor\nin the case of chatbot dataset. Whereas for the model pair\nLlama2-70B-chat-Llama-160M , the average acceptance rate\nis consistently low, especially on the finance dataset. The\nlower acceptance rate can be attributed to the large discrep-\nancy in parameter scale between LLM and SSM, which leads\nto significant challenges in aligning their token distributions.\nMoreover, Figure 1 also shows the varying capability of SSM\nacross different datasets. This is because the SSMs are fine-\ntuned on different datasets, which leads to varying perfor-\nmance in various LLM tasks. In sum, the difference in param-\neter scale and fine-tuning dataset leads to a notable capability\ngap between LLM and SSM that constrains the acceptance\nrate of SSM and thus the inference performance of speculative\ndecoding.\nTo fill the capability gap, existing work [25] adopts several\nSSMs to generate multiple speculative outputs simultaneously,\nwhich are then verified by the LLM in parallel. However, con-\ncurrent verification of multiple SSM outputs can lead to a\nsharp increase in the computation overhead for LLM, which\ncan quickly offset the performance advantage of SSM infer-\nence and ultimately degrade the inference performance of\nLLM. Observation 1: To further improve the performance\nof speculative decoding, it is challenging to take advan-\ntage of the increased capability of multiple SSMs without\nburdening the LLM verification.\n3']","Minions balance high-speed SSM speculation and memory limits during LLM verification by tracking the intermediate resulting pool to restrict the speculation speed of SSMs. Specifically, SSMs pause their execution if the volume of the intermediate resulting pool is greater than or equal to the batch size of LLM, and resume execution once the volume falls below the batch size due to LLM execution. This ensures that there are always pending requests in the intermediate resulting pool when LLM is ready to execute, preventing bubbles in the execution flow. Additionally, Minions use a majority-voted mechanism that leverages multiple SSMs to improve the acceptance rate of speculative tokens during LLM verification with a low computation cost.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '2402.15678v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.15678v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2932408, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2402.15678v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2402.15678v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2932408, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
"How does LLM-Distill-PP compare to traditional weight-sharing supernets in NAS for NLP in terms of cost, performance, and challenges?","['translation on popular WMT datasets as our downstream tasks. We discover that GPT-4 with our\nPP prompts (LLM-PP) can predict the performance of an architecture with a mean absolute error\nmatching the SOTA and a marginally worse performance in rank correlation coefficient, compared\nto SOTA weight-sharing supernet based performance predictors (Wang et al., 2020; Jawahar et al.,\n2023b).\nGiven our choice of GPT-4 for the LLM, LLM-PP requires using the GPT-4 API for scoring each\narchitecture, which makes LLM-PP prohibitively expensive to be applied for many use cases. One\nsuch use case is neural architecture search (NAS), where the goal is to find an architecture that has\noptimal performance for a given constraint on a given hardware. In NAS, PP is typically used for\neach constraint (e.g., latency ≤100ms) to score roughly 3,000 candidate architectures (Wang et al.,\n2020). The pricing of GPT-4 as of August 2023 is 0.03$ per 1Ktokens1. Assuming PP prompts\ntakes roughly one-third of 1Ktokens, the estimated cost can be ∼30$ for a single constraint on\nthe target hardware. With different constraint values (e.g., 100ms, 200ms), constraint types (e.g.,\nlatency, FLOPs, memory), target hardwares (e.g., Nvidia A100, Raspberry Pi), the total cost can\nquickly become exorbitant (e.g., 1,800$).\nHow to design cost-effective PP? To answer this, we distill the performance predictions of LLM-\nPP into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based regression model (LLM-Distill-PP), while taking the\narchitecture description (e.g., list of hyperparameters) as input features. Surprisingly, we find that\nLLM-Distill-PP can largely retain the performance of LLM-PP. Assuming LLM-Distill-PP needs\nonly 3,000 examples, the estimated cost can be ∼30$ for a single downstream task, which is amor-\ntized across different constraint values, constraint types, and target hardwares.\nCan LLM-Distill-PP speed up architecture search, while maintaining the efficiency and the\nquality of SOTA NAS? To answer this, we use LLM-Distill-PP as PP for designing efficient\nMT architectures via SOTA NAS methods such as HAT (Wang et al., 2020) and Mixture-of-\nSupernets (Jawahar et al., 2023b). We propose Hybrid-Search search algorithm (HS-NAS) where\nLLM-Distill-PP is used as PP for the first half of the search budget (i.e., 15 iterations) and a weight-\nsharing supernet (SOTA performance predictor) is used as PP for the remaining 15 search iterations.\nHS-NAS is roughly 50% faster than SOTA NAS search, while performing similarly to (or improv-\ning on) architecture designed by SOTA NAS, and in some cases, enjoying reduced latency ( ∼2%),\nFLOPs ( ∼1%), and smaller model size ( ∼2%).\nMain contributions: (1) We propose LLM-PP, which uses few-shot prompting of LLM to build\naccurate performance predictors, achieving SOTA mean absolute error. (2) We further build LLM-\nDistill-PP, which naturally enjoys a better amortized cost than LLM-PP and is applicable for PP-\nheavy use cases (3) We introduce HS-NAS, a search algorithm that cuts the NAS search time by half\ncompared to SOTA and identifies better efficient architectures, by exploiting advantages of LLM-\nDistill-PP and SOTA performance estimators. (4) We share the prompts, data used to train and\nevaluate LLM-Distill-PP models, alongside the code with detailed instructions for reproducibility.\n2 R ELATED WORK\nPerformance Predictors. A popular approach in NLP to build performance predictors is to train\na weight-sharing supernet model that jointly trains a collection of architectures by sharing their\nweights with the largest model from the given search space (Wang et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021; Xu\net al., 2022a; Jawahar et al., 2023a;b). In each training step, an architecture is randomly sampled\nfrom the search space, weights corresponding to that architecture are extracted from the correspond-\ning rows/columns from the weight matrices of the largest model and those weights are trained for\nthe task of interest. After training, the performance of an architecture can be predicted by extracting\nweights corresponding to that architecture and measuring on the validation set of the task. The main\nchallenges in supernet training include: (i) weight co-adaptation (Bender et al., 2018; Zhao et al.,\n2021), (ii) capacity bottleneck (Jawahar et al., 2023b), and (iii) gradient conflict (Gong et al., 2021).\nNAS for NLP. Neural architecture search (NAS) is a general framework used to design efficient\nNLP architectures that satisfy user-defined constraints. The generality of NAS spans the following\nkey dimensions: (i) architecture family : encoder-only (Yin et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022a; 2021;\n2022b), decoder-only (Javaheripi et al., 2022), encoder-decoder (Wang et al., 2020; Jawahar et al.,\n1https://openai.com/pricing\n2', 'ChatGPT and GPT-4. For ChatGPT, LLM-Distill-PP improves over LLM-PP on average MAE and\nKendall-Tau by roughly 17%. For GPT-4, LLM-Distill-PP lags behind LLM-PP in average MAE by\n7%, while enjoying similar Kendall-Tau. Impressively, LLM-Distill-PP achieves the SOTA MAE\nfor WMT’14 En-De task, with an improvement over LLM-PP by 20%. The improvements of LLM-\nDistill-PP can be due to two factors. First is regularization , where LLM-Distill-PP’s simple model\ndesign of using regression model of few layers outweighs the complicated modeling of LLM un-\nderlying LLM-PP. Another regularization aspect is due to LLM-Distill-PP’s simplistic architecture-\nspecific features. The second factor is LLM-Distill-PP’s context specialization where few thousands\nof examples are used to follow the task. On the other hand, LLM-PP has to rely only on the compo-\nnents of PP prompt (including few demonstrations) and pretrained knowledge to follow the task.\n7 LLM-D ISTILL -PP FOR ARCHITECTURE SEARCH\nAlgorithm 1 Hybrid-Search algorithm for Neural Architecture Search (HS-NAS).

In NAS, performance predictors\nare typically used to rank a set of candidate architectures to identify high-performing architectures.\nAs discussed in Section 2, existing NAS research for NLP primarily use weight-sharing supernet as\na performance predictor. Hence, we study the interesting research question: Can LLM-Distill-PP\nspeed up architecture search, while maintaining the efficiency and the quality of SOTA NAS? To this\nend, we propose the Hybrid-Search algorithm for NAS (HS-NAS), which will be detailed now.\n7.1 H YBRID -SEARCH ALGORITHM FOR NAS\nThe key idea behind HS-NAS algorithm is to use the LLM-Distill-PP for subset of the search it-\nerations, while resorting to supernet for the rest of the iterations. In this work, we apply this\ngeneral idea on the evolutionary search algorithm proposed in HAT. The details of the HS-NAS\nalgorithm is shown in Algorithm 1, where the changes to HAT’s search algorithm are high-\nlighted in red color. LLM-Distill-PP will be used as performance predictor for all the search it-\n7']","LLM-Distill-PP offers a more cost-effective solution compared to traditional weight-sharing supernets in NAS for NLP. It retains a high level of performance prediction quality while significantly reducing costs. Traditional weight-sharing supernets face challenges such as weight co-adaptation, capacity bottleneck, and gradient conflict. LLM-Distill-PP, on the other hand, benefits from regularization and context specialization, which contribute to its efficiency and effectiveness.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2310.16712v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.16712v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 678187, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '7', 'file_name': '2310.16712v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.16712v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 678187, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

The output of these proce-\ndures is faithful, because if a given candidate out-\nput is not synonymous with a claim for which the\nmodel has have explicit evidence, it is not printed.10\n5.6 The Limits of Factual or Faithful LLMs\nAny model of the type of Model 5.13 is limited\nin what it can say by the size of its evidence base.\nIn practice, the dimension of ˆEmay be consider-\nably smaller than the parametric knowledge of the\nlanguage stored in many LLMs. Any use-case for\nfactual LLMs requires the collection and verifica-\ntion of a large amount of factual information. Any\nfactual or faithful LLM can only generate as much\noutput as it can verify.\n10Wittgenstein (1922, 189): “Whereof one cannot speak,\nthereof one must remain silent.” This also applies to LLMs.6 Conclusions\nLLMs hallucinate because their output is not con-\nstrained to be semantically consistent with their\ninputs, so there is no guarantee that any evidence\nabout the world contained in their inputs is pre-\nserved in their outputs.\nTo build a faithful or factual LLM it is necessary\nto constrain the output of a model to be consis-\ntent with claims for which the model has explicit\nevidence.\nIn practice, this means acquiring large bodies of\nmachine-readable string evidence or using sensors\n(perceptual learning) combined with sensor-to-text\nencoders (extensional learning) to validate the out-\nput of an LLM with evidence. Paraphrase learning\nmethods can be used to expand the LLM’s vocab-\nulary (intensional learning). We propose a simple\nmethod to implement this in practice via rejection\nsampling.\nAny input-faithful LLM is limited in what it\ncan say by what it has evidence for. Generating\nlarge-scale evidence bases is likely to be a much\nbigger binding constraint that the parameter size of\nthe model, for instance, and may require a rethink\nof how computational and financial resources are\nallocated to the design of LLMs. This is a challenge\nfor the next generation of LLMs.\nAlgorithm 2 LBP: Multimodal-to-Text\n1:Input: (Ωobs, L, L+, C, P )\n2:Learn: ˆf(x|C, P) ▷LLM\n3:Learn: ˆf(ωobs) ▷Perceptual\n4:Learn: ∀ℓ+∈L+:ˆf(ℓ+|ωobs)▷Extensional\n5:Learn: ∀ℓ∈L:ˆf(ℓ∈I(ℓ+))▷Intensional\n6:forℓ+∈L+do\n7: iff(ℓ+|ωobs)f(ωobs) = 1 then\n8: ˆE←ˆE∪ℓ+\n9: end if\n10:end for\n11:forℓ∈Ldo\n12: ifℓ∈I(ℓ+)∧ℓ+∈ˆEthen\n13: ˆE←ˆE∪ℓ\n14: end if\n15:end for\n16:Generate: ˆy∼ˆf(x|C, P) ▷Babble\n17:ifˆy∈ˆEthen ▷Prune\n18: Print: ˆy\n19:else\n20: Print: “I don’t know.”\n21:end if', '(perceptual learning ); they must learn which\nsentences map onto which states of the world\n(extensional learning ); and they must learn which\nsentences have the same meaning ( intensional\nlearning ). A factual speaker performs the same\ntasks, with the difference that their evidence about\nthe world is correct. Here, faithfulness to model\ninputs is conceptually prior to factuality, since, def-\ninitionally, the information the model has about the\nworld is contained in its inputs.\nWe use this setup to state an impossibility result:\nneural probabilistic language models in the vein of\nBengio et al. (2003) are not factual (Theorem 4.5).\nLLMs maximize the conditional probability of the\ngenerated strings given the corpus and the prompt.\nThey do not explicitly learn states of the world, do\nnot explicitly learn the meanings of words, and do\nnot explicitly learn the referents of sentences. Each\nof these types of information is unobserved. As a re-\nsult, the conditional distributions learned by LLMs\ncan be statistically independent of, or invariant to,\ntheir semantic content: that is, of the referents and\nthe truth-conditions of the sentences in the corpus\nand prompts. So we may have variation in the truth\nor falsity of a state of the world without variation\nin the solution to a predictive model that generates\nthe next sentence given a prompt.\nBecause this semantic information is not con-\ntained in the conditional distribution from which\nan output string is generated, simulating from the\nlearned distribution does not preserve this infor-\nmation, even when it is contained in the corpus\n(Theorem 4.6). Hence there is no guarantee that\nLLMs are faithful to the semantic content of their\ninputs, either. We can think of this as the cause of\nhallucination in LLMs.\nSecond, we show conceptually how to build a\nfaithful or factual LLM. The output of such an\nLLM must satisfy evidential closure : that is, its\noutput must be synonymous with claims for which\nthe LLM has evidence. This ensures that every\nclaim made by the model is either directly corrobo-\nrated by evidence, or is a paraphrase of a directly\ncorroborated claim. We first define the objective\nfunctions for faithful and factual LLMs using the-\nory from the philosophy of language. We then\ndecompose those objective functions into learnable\ndistributions (Model 5.9). We show that the output\nof these models is faithful or factual, because it\nsolves the constrained learning task that incorpo-\nrates semantic information about the truth or fal-sity of sentences for which the model has evidence\n(Theorem 5.10 and Theorem 5.11).\nThird, we provide heuristic framework for build-\ning factual or faithful LLMs, which we call Learn-\nBabble-Prune . In this setup, the output of an LLM\nis cross-checked against its evidence, and discarded\nif it is not a paraphrase of a claim that it has evi-\ndence for. This ensures that the output of an LLM\nis consistent with its evidence. This ensures that\nthe LLM is faithful to its evidence , and hence, does\nnot hallucinate.\nWe consider two applications: when the evi-\ndence is a corpus of strings, and when the evidence\nis in the form of sensor information.\nIf the evidence is in the form of text, as in some\nretrieval-augmented language models (Guu et al.,\n2020; Chen et al., 2017), then an LLM’s output is\nconsistent with its retrieved body of evidence if its\noutput is a paraphrase of a string in its evidence\nbase. In this application, the model must learn\nparaphrases of sentences in order to cross-check\nthe output of an LLM with its evidence base.3\nIf the evidence is in the form of information\nabout the world gathered by sensors, as in some\nmultimodal LLMs (Lian et al., 2023; Zhao et al.,\n2023b; Yuan et al., 2022), then, in addition to in-\ntensional learning, the LLM must learn a mapping\nfrom perceptual information to strings. Thus a mul-\ntimodal LLM is faithful if its output paraphrases\ninformation acquired by its perceptual learner, and\nfactual if that perceptual learner is unbiased and\nconsistent.\nA final point is that, like any language speaker,\nan LLM can only make as many true claims as are\nsemantically entailed by the evidence it possesses\n(Williamson, 2000). Collecting and interpreting\nlarge bodies of evidence is a vitally important task\nfor the next generation of LLMs.\n2 Related work\n2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nSeveral approaches ground LLMs in external tex-\ntual knowledge bases (Chen et al., 2017; Lee et al.,\n2019; Guu et al., 2020), in which a retriever model\n3Intensional learning allows the speaker to say true things\nthat they have never heard before: given a candidate string ℓ,\nthe speaker can verify it by first verifying the state of the world\nunderpinning a different string ℓ+, and then verifying that ℓis\nintensionally equivalent to ℓ+. This is an example of semantic\nentailment (Beth, 1955). A fluent speaker of a language must\nbe able to generalize beyond a set of observed sentence-use\ninstances, and intensional learning allows speakers to do this.']","Perceptual learning aids in evidential closure by using sensors to gather information about the world and mapping this information to strings. Extensional learning aids by designating a test set of images as ground truth and applying a visual encoder to this test set, thereby validating the output of an LLM with evidence.

How do KGs tackle LLMs' factual inaccuracies and interpretability issues?,"['JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. ??, NO. ??, MONTH 20YY 1\nUnifying Large Language Models and\nKnowledge Graphs: A Roadmap\nShirui Pan, Senior Member, IEEE , Linhao Luo,\nYufei Wang, Chen Chen, Jiapu Wang, Xindong Wu, Fellow, IEEE\nAbstract —Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves in the field of natural language\nprocessing and artificial intelligence, due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box models, which\noften fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example,\nare structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge\nfor inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods\nin KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and\nsimultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs.\nOur roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and\ninference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs,\nthat leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question\nanswering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs , in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance\nboth LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge.

Pros. and Cons. are selected\nbased on their representativeness. Detailed discussion can be found in\nAppendix A.\nDespite their success in many applications, LLMs have\nbeen criticized for their lack of factual knowledge. Specif-\nically, LLMs memorize facts and knowledge contained in\nthe training corpus [14]. However, further studies reveal\nthat LLMs are not able to recall facts and often experience\nhallucinations by generating statements that are factually\n0000–0000/00$00.00 © 2023 IEEEarXiv:2306.08302v3  [cs.CL]  25 Jan 2024', 'JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. ??, NO. ??, MONTH 20YY 2\nincorrect [15], [28]. For example, LLMs might say “Ein-\nstein discovered gravity in 1687” when asked, “When did\nEinstein discover gravity?”, which contradicts the fact that\nIsaac Newton formulated the gravitational theory. This issue\nseverely impairs the trustworthiness of LLMs.\nAs black-box models, LLMs are also criticized for their\nlack of interpretability. LLMs represent knowledge implic-\nitly in their parameters. It is difficult to interpret or validate\nthe knowledge obtained by LLMs. Moreover, LLMs perform\nreasoning by a probability model, which is an indecisive\nprocess [16]. The specific patterns and functions LLMs\nused to arrive at predictions or decisions are not directly\naccessible or explainable to humans [17]. Even though some\nLLMs are equipped to explain their predictions by applying\nchain-of-thought [29], their reasoning explanations also suf-\nfer from the hallucination issue [30]. This severely impairs\nthe application of LLMs in high-stakes scenarios, such as\nmedical diagnosis and legal judgment. For instance, in a\nmedical diagnosis scenario, LLMs may incorrectly diagnose\na disease and provide explanations that contradict medical\ncommonsense. This raises another issue that LLMs trained\non general corpus might not be able to generalize well\nto specific domains or new knowledge due to the lack of\ndomain-specific knowledge or new training data [18].\nTo address the above issues, a potential solution is to in-\ncorporate knowledge graphs (KGs) into LLMs. Knowledge\ngraphs (KGs), storing enormous facts in the way of triples,\ni.e.,(head entity, relation, tail entity ), are a structured and\ndecisive manner of knowledge representation (e.g., Wiki-\ndata [20], YAGO [31], and NELL [32]). KGs are crucial for\nvarious applications as they offer accurate explicit knowl-\nedge [19]. Besides, they are renowned for their symbolic\nreasoning ability [22], which generates interpretable results.\nKGs can also actively evolve with new knowledge contin-\nuously added in [24]. Additionally, experts can construct\ndomain-specific KGs to provide precise and dependable\ndomain-specific knowledge [23].\nNevertheless, KGs are difficult to construct [25], and\ncurrent approaches in KGs [27], [33], [34] are inadequate\nin handling the incomplete and dynamically changing na-\nture of real-world KGs. These approaches fail to effectively\nmodel unseen entities and represent new facts. In addition,\nthey often ignore the abundant textual information in KGs.\nMoreover, existing methods in KGs are often customized for\nspecific KGs or tasks, which are not generalizable enough.\nTherefore, it is also necessary to utilize LLMs to address the\nchallenges faced in KGs. We summarize the pros and cons\nof LLMs and KGs in Fig. 1, respectively.\nRecently, the possibility of unifying LLMs with KGs has\nattracted increasing attention from researchers and practi-\ntioners. LLMs and KGs are inherently interconnected and\ncan mutually enhance each other. In KG-enhanced LLMs ,\nKGs can not only be incorporated into the pre-training and\ninference stages of LLMs to provide external knowledge\n[35]–[37], but also used for analyzing LLMs and provid-\ning interpretability [14], [38], [39]. In LLM-augmented KGs ,\nLLMs have been used in various KG-related tasks, e.g., KG\nembedding [40], KG completion [26], KG construction [41],\nKG-to-text generation [42], and KGQA [43], to improve the\nperformance and facilitate the application of KGs. In Syn-\nergized LLM + KG , researchers marries the merits of LLMsand KGs to mutually enhance performance in knowledge\nrepresentation [44] and reasoning [45], [46]. Although there\nare some surveys on knowledge-enhanced LLMs [47]–[49],\nwhich mainly focus on using KGs as an external knowledge\nto enhance LLMs, they ignore other possibilities of integrat-\ning KGs for LLMs and the potential role of LLMs in KG\napplications.\nIn this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for\nunifying both LLMs and KGs, to leverage their respective\nstrengths and overcome the limitations of each approach,\nfor various downstream tasks. We propose detailed cate-\ngorization, conduct comprehensive reviews, and pinpoint\nemerging directions in these fast-growing fields. Our main\ncontributions are summarized as follows:\n1)Roadmap.

We define a lie as an incorrect statement made by a speaker who is aware of its inaccuracy.\nMany malicious uses of LLMs may involve lies by this definition. E.g., assume someone uses\nan LLM to spread a conspiracy theory. An LLM that was trained on web-scraped data would\nhave learnt many relevant facts that contradict the conspiracy theory. One can certainly prompt or\nfine-tune the LLM to advocate for the conspiracy theory nonetheless. However, the contradicting\nfacts would still be present in the LLMs, which could potentially be detected with a lie detector.\nOne could avoid lie detection by editing the LLM to erase all relevant knowledge. However, this is\ndifficult, as model-editing is an unsolved problem. One could also train an LLM from scratch with\nfiltered pre-training data. Again, this is difficult and expensive.\nEuropol.

Compared with encyclopedic\nknowledge graphs, domain-specific knowledge graphs are\noften smaller in size, but more accurate and reliable. For\nexample, UMLS [77] is a domain-specific knowledge graph\nin the medical domain, which contains biomedical concepts\nand their relationships. In addition, there are some domain-\nspecific knowledge graphs in other domains, such as finance\n[78], geology [79], biology [80], chemistry [81] and geneal-\nogy [82].\n2.2.4 Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs.\nUnlike conventional knowledge graphs that only contain\ntextual information, multi-modal knowledge graphs repre-\nsent facts in multiple modalities such as images, sounds,\nand videos [83]. For example, IMGpedia [84], MMKG [85],\nand Richpedia [86] incorporate both the text and image\ninformation into the knowledge graphs. These knowledge\ngraphs can be used for various multi-modal tasks such as\nimage-text matching [87], visual question answering [88],\nand recommendation [89].\n2.3 Applications\nLLMs as KGs have been widely applied in various\nreal-world applications. We summarize some representa-\ntive applications of using LLMs and KGs in Table 1.\nChatGPT/GPT-4 are LLM-based chatbots that can commu-\nnicate with humans in a natural dialogue format. To im-\nprove knowledge awareness of LLMs, ERNIE 3.0 and Bard\nincorporate KGs into their chatbot applications. Instead ofChatbot. Firefly develops a photo editing application that\nallows users to edit photos by using natural language de-\nscriptions. Copilot, New Bing, and Shop.ai adopt LLMs to\nempower their applications in the areas of coding assistant,\nweb search, and recommendation, respectively. Wikidata\nand KO are two representative knowledge graph applica-\ntions that are used to provide external knowledge. OpenBG\n[90] is a knowledge graph designed for recommendation.\nDoctor.ai develops a health care assistant that incorporates\nLLMs and KGs to provide medical advice.\n3 R OADMAP & C ATEGORIZATION\nIn this section, we first present a road map of explicit\nframeworks that unify LLMs and KGs. Then, we present\nthe categorization of research on unifying LLMs and KGs.\n3.1 Roadmap\nThe roadmap of unifying KGs and LLMs is illustrated in\nFig. 6. In the roadmap, we identify three frameworks for\nthe unification of LLMs and KGs, including KG-enhanced\nLLMs, LLM-augmented KGs, and Synergized LLMs + KGs.\nThe KG-enhanced LLMs and LLM-augmented KGs are two\nparallel frameworks that aim to enhance the capabilities of\nLLMs and KGs, respectively. Building upon these frame-\nworks, Synergized LLMs + KGs is a unified framework that\naims to synergize LLMs and KGs to mutually enhance each\nother.\n3.1.1 KG-enhanced LLMs\nLLMs are renowned for their ability to learn knowledge\nfrom large-scale corpus and achieve state-of-the-art per-\nformance in various NLP tasks. However, LLMs are often\ncriticized for their hallucination issues [15], and lacking of\ninterpretability. To address these issues, researchers have\nproposed to enhance LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs).\nKGs store enormous knowledge in an explicit and struc-\ntured way, which can be used to enhance the knowledge\nawareness of LLMs. Some researchers have proposed to\nincorporate KGs into LLMs during the pre-training stage,\nwhich can help LLMs learn knowledge from KGs [35], [91].\nOther researchers have proposed to incorporate KGs into\nLLMs during the inference stage. By retrieving knowledge\nfrom KGs, it can significantly improve the performance\nof LLMs in accessing domain-specific knowledge [92]. To\nimprove the interpretability of LLMs, researchers also utilize', 'JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. ??, NO. ??, MONTH 20YY 6\nStructural\nFactT ext\nCorpusImageKGs LLMsExplicit Knowledge\nDomain-speciﬁc Knowledge\nDecisiveness\nInterpretability\nGeneral Knowledge\nLanguage Processing\nGeneralizabilityPrompt Engineering Graph Neural Network\nRepresentation Learning Neural-symbolic ReasoningIn-context Learning\nFew-shot LearningSearch\nEngineRecommender\nSystemDialogue\nSystemAI\nAssistant\nV ideo DataSynergized\nModelT echniqueApplication\nFig. 7.

Existing methods in KGs\nfall short of handling incomplete KGs [33] and processing\ntext corpus to construct KGs [93]. With the generalizability\nof LLMs, many researchers are trying to harness the power\nof LLMs for addressing KG-related tasks.\nThe most straightforward way to apply LLMs as text\nencoders for KG-related tasks. Researchers take advantage\nof LLMs to process the textual corpus in the KGs and then\nuse the representations of the text to enrich KGs representa-\ntion [94]. Some studies also use LLMs to process the original\ncorpus and extract relations and entities for KG construction\n[95]. Recent studies try to design a KG prompt that can\neffectively convert structural KGs into a format that can be\ncomprehended by LLMs. In this way, LLMs can be directly\napplied to KG-related tasks, e.g., KG completion [96] and\nKG reasoning [97].\n3.1.3 Synergized LLMs + KGs\nThe synergy of LLMs and KGs has attracted increasing\nattention from researchers these years [40], [42]. LLMs and\nKGs are two inherently complementary techniques, which\nshould be unified into a general framework to mutually\nenhance each other.\nTo further explore the unification, we propose a unified\nframework of the synergized LLMs + KGs in Fig. 7. The\nunified framework contains four layers: 1) Data ,2) Syner-\ngized Model ,3) Technique , and 4) Application . In the Data layer,\nLLMs and KGs are used to process the textual and structural\ndata, respectively. With the development of multi-modal\nLLMs [98] and KGs [99], this framework can be extended\nto process multi-modal data, such as video, audio, andimages. In the Synergized Model layer, LLMs and KGs could\nsynergize with each other to improve their capabilities. In\nTechnique layer, related techniques that have been used in\nLLMs and KGs can be incorporated into this framework to\nfurther enhance the performance. In the Application layer,\nLLMs and KGs can be integrated to address various real-\nworld applications, such as search engines [100], recom-\nmender systems [10], and AI assistants [101].\n3.2 Categorization\nTo better understand the research on unifying LLMs and\nKGs, we further provide a fine-grained categorization for\neach framework in the roadmap. Specifically, we focus\non different ways of integrating KGs and LLMs, i.e., KG-\nenhanced LLMs, KG-augmented LLMs, and Synergized\nLLMs + KGs. The fine-grained categorization of the research\nis illustrated in Fig. 8.\nKG-enhanced LLMs. Integrating KGs can enhance the\nperformance and interpretability of LLMs in various down-\nstream tasks. We categorize the research on KG-enhanced\nLLMs into three groups:\n1) KG-enhanced LLM pre-training includes works that\napply KGs during the pre-training stage and im-\nprove the knowledge expression of LLMs.\n2) KG-enhanced LLM inference includes research that\nutilizes KGs during the inference stage of LLMs,\nwhich enables LLMs to access the latest knowledge\nwithout retraining.\n3) KG-enhanced LLM interpretability includes works that\nuse KGs to understand the knowledge learned by\nLLMs and interpret the reasoning process of LLMs.\nLLM-augmented KGs. LLMs can be applied to augment\nvarious KG-related tasks. We categorize the research on\nLLM-augmented KGs into five groups based on the task\ntypes:\n1) LLM-augmented KG embedding includes studies that\napply LLMs to enrich representations of KGs by\nencoding the textual descriptions of entities and\nrelations.\n2) LLM-augmented KG completion includes papers that\nutilize LLMs to encode text or generate facts for\nbetter KGC performance.\n3) LLM-augmented KG construction includes works that\napply LLMs to address the entity discovery, corefer-\nence resolution, and relation extraction tasks for KG\nconstruction.\n4) LLM-augmented KG-to-text Generation includes re-\nsearch that utilizes LLMs to generate natural lan-\nguage that describes the facts from KGs.\n5) LLM-augmented KG question answering includes stud-\nies that apply LLMs to bridge the gap between\nnatural language questions and retrieve answers\nfrom KGs.\nSynergized LLMs + KGs. The synergy of LLMs and KGs\naims to integrate LLMs and KGs into a unified framework\nto mutually enhance each other. In this categorization, we\nreview the recent attempts of Synergized LLMs + KGs from\nthe perspectives of knowledge representation and reasoning .\nIn the following sections (Sec 4, 5, and 6), we will provide\ndetails on these categorizations.']","KG-enhanced LLMs boost accuracy and interpretability by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) during the pre-training and inference stages.

Profiling\ninvolves running both the reference LLM, which is typically the\nmost expensive, and the other LLMs on the same input instance.\nOur hope is that the cost of using the reference LLM is offset by\nthe savings from employing a less expensive LLM for processing\nthe remaining items after profiling. However, profiling costs can\noutweigh the cost savings when a large number of items are needed\nto validate an LLM with Unknown status as either Valid orInvalid .\nTherefore, we estimate the expected cost savings from profiling\nadditional items and terminate early if the projected savings are\nnot positive.// Given profiled LLMs 𝑀, reference LLM 𝑚, accuracy constraint 𝛿,\nconfidence level 𝛾, and the remaining 𝑛items, terminate profiling if\nfurther profiling is expected to be wasteful (or a valid LLM is as cheap\nas any LLM with unknown status).\n1:function TerminateProfile[ProfileSmart] (𝑀,𝑚,𝛿,𝛾,𝑛 )\n// Terminate if a valid LLM is as cheap as any unknown LLM.\n2: ifTerminateProfile[ProfileAll] (𝑀):\n3: return True\n// Find current cheapest LLM satisfying accuracy constraint.\n4:𝑚←arg min{𝑚∈𝑀|𝑚.𝑠=Valid}𝑚.𝑐\n// Compute the expected cost if profiling terminates at this point.\n5:𝑐←𝑛·𝑚.𝑐\n// Store expected costs for varying numbers of profiled items.\n6:𝑘=1\n7: while𝑘≤𝑛:\n// Compute the expected cost if profiling exactly 𝑘more items.\n8:𝑐𝑘←Cost(𝑘,𝑀,𝑚,𝑚,𝛿,𝛾,𝑛)\n9:𝑘←2·𝑘\n// Terminate if further profiling is expected to be wasteful.\n10: if𝑐≤min𝑘𝑐𝑘:\n11: return True\n12: return False\nAlgorithm 6: Terminate profiling if further profiling is ex-\npected to be wasteful.\nAlgorithm 6 illustrates the newly added termination criterion\nbased on expected cost savings. First, we calculate the expected\ncost of using the most cost-efficient LLM among the current set of\nValid LLMs to process the remaining items. For that, we multiply\nthe number of remaining items by the unit cost (refer to 𝑚.𝑐in\nTable 1) of the cheapest Valid LLM. This serves as a baseline,\nassuming we cease profiling at this juncture and proceed to the\napplication phase. Next, we assess the impact of profiling more\nitems on the overall cost. Specifically, we calculate the expected\ncosts for different values of 𝑘, where𝑘represents the number of\nadditionally profiled items. We do not know a priori which number\nof profiled items will yield the optimal balance between profiling\noverheads and the cost savings in the application phase. Hence, we\nstart with𝑘=1and incrementally double its value up to the number\nof remaining items. This exponential scheme is reasonable, given\nthat profiling too many items would be wasteful, and the search\nshould concentrate on the range with smaller values. Finally, we\ncompare the lowest among the costs of profiling additional items\nagainst the cost of halting profiling at this point. We terminate\nprofiling if setting 𝑘=0minimizes expected costs.\nTheCost function in Algorithm 6 calculates the expected cost of\nprofiling LLMs for exactly 𝑘more items, followed by the application\nphase. That is, we continue profiling for 𝑘additional items and then\nprocess remaining items based on the newly collected information.\nTo compute the expected cost, we first need to determine for each\nLLM𝑚with Unknown status (i.e.,𝑚.𝑠=Unknown ) whether𝑚will\neventually be considered Valid after profiling for 𝑘more items.\nWe express the probability that LLM 𝑚will be evaluated as Valid\nas the following:\nPr(𝑚.𝑠=Valid|𝑘,𝛿,𝛾)\nNext, we assign a sort order to LLMs based on their unit costs\n(since the same prompt is used for all LLMs, this effectively amounts\n5', '// Given profiled LLMs 𝑀, question𝑞, remaining inputs 𝐼, and the ratio\nof items processed during profiling 𝑟, process remaining items using\nmultiple LLMs to minimize cost while satisfying the accuracy constraint\n𝛿with a confidence level 𝛾.\n1:function Apply[ModelMix] (𝑀,𝑞,𝐼,𝛿,𝛾,𝑟 )\n// Find ratio per LLM.\n2:{𝑟𝑚}𝑚∈𝑀←ComputeRatios(𝑀,𝛿,𝛾,𝑟)\n// Split remaining items based on ratios.\n3:{𝐼𝑚}𝑚∈𝑀←PartitionByRatios (𝐼,{𝑟𝑚})\n// Process remaining items.\n4:𝑂←∅\n5: for all𝑚∈𝑀do\n6: for all𝑖∈𝐼𝑚do\n7: 𝑜←𝑚(𝑞,𝑖)\n8: 𝑂←𝑂∪{⟨𝑖,𝑜⟩}\n9: return𝑂\nAlgorithm 7: Multiple-models application.\nemploy a single LLM to process the remaining items in the appli-\ncation phase. This earlier method misses a potential opportunity\nfor additional cost savings. Consider an LLM that is more cost-\nefficient but has an accuracy lower bound just below the accuracy\nthreshold. Such slight shortfall in accuracy disqualifies the LLM\nas a valid option for application in the previous method. However,\nrecognizing that its accuracy is close to the user-defined threshold,\nSmart-ModelMix proposes a novel approach. The main idea in-\nvolves combining this LLM with an LLM with a higher accuracy. By\npartitioning the processing of remaining items between the more\neconomical LLM and a more expensive, higher-accuracy LLM, we\ncan realize further cost reductions.\nAlgorithm 7 describes the novel approach for the application\nphase. At its heart is the ComputeRatio function, which determines\nthe percentage of remaining items that each LLM should process.\nThis calculation is based on solving a mixed integer linear program,\nwith further details provided in the subsequent paragraphs. We then\npartition the remaining items according to the determined ratios\nand process them using the respective LLMs. Due to this careful\npartitioning, we ensure that the generated outputs, in aggregate,\nmeet the accuracy constraint at the designated confidence level.\nWe provide a detailed explanation of the ComputeRatio function.\nOur objective is to minimize the cost of processing the remaining\nitems while adhering to the accuracy constraint. To achieve this,\nwe focus on minimizing the cost function below, where 𝑖indexes\nall available LLMs:\nmin\n𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑥𝑖\nwhere𝑐𝑖is the unit cost of an LLM 𝑚𝑖and𝑥𝑖∈[0,1]is the ratio of\nitems processed by model 𝑚𝑖. The ratios 𝑥𝑖should sum up to one:Í\n𝑖𝑥𝑖=1.\nThere are two key constraints associated with this minimization\nproblem: 1) accuracy constraint and 2) confidence level constraint.\nWe need to guarantee that, after processing all items, we satisfy\nthe accuracy threshold 1−𝛿with confidence 𝛾. To specify these\nconstraints, we first introduce a separate confidence level 𝛾𝑖for\neach LLM𝑚𝑖. The main idea is that the combined confidence of\nthese individual confidence levels 𝛾𝑖should be greater than or equal\nto the confidence constraint 𝛾. As a result, assuming independence\nbetween confidence levels, we get the confidence level constraintas follows:Ö\n𝑖𝛾𝑖≥𝛾 (2)\nHere, without loss of generality, we say that LLMs (except for the\nreference model) exhibit zero accuracy lower bound for a 100%\nconfidence level.\nThen, we specify the accuracy constraint based on the accuracy\nlower bound of each LLM 𝑚𝑖. First, we compute the lower bound 𝑙𝑖\non the accuracy of LLM 𝑚𝑖, using the binomial confidence intervals\nwith confidence 𝛾𝑖. That is, for each LLM 𝑚𝑖, given the number of\nprocessed items, 𝑚𝑖.𝑛, and the number of items whose outputs con-\nform with the reference LLM, 𝑚𝑖.𝑒, we calculate the lower bound\nfrom the function BinomCI (𝑚𝑖.𝑛,𝑚𝑖.𝑒,𝛾𝑖). Now, we need to guar-\nantee that the final accuracy satisfies the given accuracy constraint.\nIn other words, we want the accumulated accuracy over all items\nto be at least the same as the accuracy threshold. We temporarily\ndenote this accuracy threshold by 𝛼instead of the previously used\n1−𝛿(since its value slightly differs from 1−𝛿, a distinction we will\nexplain shortly). Given the accuracy lower bound 𝑙𝑖per LLM𝑚𝑖,\nwe specify the accuracy constraint as:\n∑︁\n𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑥𝑖≥𝛼 (3)\nWhen computing the final accuracy over all items, we should also\ntake into account the items that we processed during the profiling\nphase (which we processed using the reference LLM). In that, we\nuse a slightly refined version of the accuracy threshold (instead of\n𝛼=1−𝛿) in this optimization problem. Note that the accuracy\nof the reference LLM is one, as we define accuracy in terms of\nconsistency with the outputs of the reference model. Denoting by\n𝑟the ratio of items processed in the profiling phase to the total\nnumber of items, we solve the following equation to get the refined\naccuracy threshold 𝛼:\n1·𝑟+𝛼(1−𝑟)=1−𝛿⇒𝛼=1−𝛿\n1−𝑟\nWe solve this minimization problem for 𝑥𝑖to find the optimal\nratios for distributing the remaining items to LLMs. However, solv-\ning this problem directly is difficult due to the non-elementary\nnatural of computing quantiles (e.g., Gauss error function if using\na normal approximation). That is, it is hard to express the accu-\nracy lower bounds 𝑙𝑖as an elementary function of other variables.\nInstead, we define a fixed set of potential confidence levels {𝛾𝑗}\nwhere each level is indexed by 𝑗(instead of𝑖). Then, we introduce\na binary variable 𝑦𝑖𝑗∈{0,1}that indicates whether the LLM 𝑚𝑖\noperates under the confidence level 𝛾𝑗. We assign at most one confi-\ndence level per LLM, thereby introducing the following constraint:\n∀𝑖:Í\n𝑗𝑦𝑖𝑗≤1. In our implementation, we utilize a range of confi-\ndence levels starting from the user-defined confidence level 𝛾up\nto one, with an increment of 0.01. For instance, if a user specifies\na confidence level of 0.95, we consider potential confidence levels\n𝛾𝑗∈{0.95,0.96,0.97,0.98,0.99,1}. Now, we reformulate the two\nconstraints in Equations 2 and 3.\nFirst, we rewrite the accuracy constraint in Equation 3. Since\nwe specify predefined values {𝛾𝑗}for confidence levels, we can\ncompute the accuracy lower bound 𝑙𝑖𝑗for each combination of\nLLM𝑚𝑖and confidence level 𝛾𝑗. Now, we replace the term 𝑙𝑖in\n7']","Smart-ProfileSmart ends profiling by calculating the expected cost savings from profiling additional items and terminates early if the projected savings are not positive.

How do Mini-CEX changes and radiology metrics improve LLM evaluation in diagnostics?,"['always align with clinicians’ preferences. The introduc-\ntion of clinical radiology-tailored metrics, accompanied\nby expert assessments on aspects like clinical relevance,\noffers a more grounded evaluation. Both Yuan et al.[21]\nand Xu et al.[180] have developed metrics based on clin-\nical evaluations to further refine model assessment. The\nrobust evaluation process begins with pilot studies, fol-\nlowed by expert peer reviews, culminating in real-world\nclinical tests. This comprehensive framework ensures not\nonly the model’s accuracy but also its applicability and\nsafety. Once thoroughly vetted, such models can gradu-\nally integrate into clinical workflows, aiding professionals\nin diagnostics, treatment suggestions, and more.\nModel Scoring To address the resource-intensive na-\nture of manual assessments, researchers [181, 182, 183,\n184, 185, 102] are exploring LLM-based scoring systems\nlike GPT-Eval [181] and LLM-Mini-CEX [182]. These\nsystems employ model-centric strategies, wherein one\nLLM, usually GPT-4 [6], evaluates another one’s med-\nical dialogues. For instance, GPT-Eval [181] provides a\nmethodology where the task and criteria are fed into an\nLLM, leading to a series of evaluation steps that another\nLLM uses for assessment. LLM-Mini-CEX [182] offers\na unique LLM-tailored criterion, streamlining evaluation\nof diagnostic abilities by automating interactions using a\npatient simulator and ChatGPT. However, these meth-\nods face challenges related to transparency, accuracy, and\nsometimes limited diagnostic performance, as noted by\nShi et al. [182].\nOther Aspects There are also evaluations focusing\non unique LLM characteristics [51], such as faith-\nfulness [186], hallucination [187], safety [188], and\nrobustness against adversarial interventions [189]. For\nexample, to address the challenges posed by hallucina-\ntions in LLMs, particularly in the context of the medical\ndomain, Med-HALT [187] provides a diverse multi-\nnational dataset derived from medical examinations\nacross various countries and includes multiple innovative\ntesting modalities, especially reasoning hallucination\ntests.\nIn summary, as LLMs show promising advancements\nin the medical domain, rigorous and comprehensive\nevaluations are crucial. A combination of automated\nmetrics, expert evaluations, and real-world testing en-\nsures the models’ efficacy and safety. As technology and\nmedicine further intertwine, evaluation frameworks must\nevolve accordingly to ensure the best patient outcomes.\nOnce a model passes this framework, its gradual inte-\ngration into clinical workflows can commence, starting\nwith tasks like summarizing medical records or aiding\nin diagnostics, but always under medical professionals’\nsupervision.7 Discussion\nIn this review, we have meticulously navigated through\nthe multifaceted landscape of Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs) in the medical domain, illuminating their\npromising potential. We initiated our exploration by\ndelving into the foundational applications of LLMs\nin medicine, emphasizing text-based interactions and\ndistinguishing between general-purpose and specialized\nmedical LLMs. Recognizing the inherent multimodality\nof the medical field, our discussion transitioned to mul-\ntimodal LLMs, highlighting their capability to integrate\ndiverse data types and thereby augment diagnostic accu-\nracy. Despite these advancements, we acknowledged the\npersisting challenges such as the need for personalized\nresponses, maintaining currency with the latest medi-\ncal knowledge, and navigating complex problem-solving\nscenarios—skills that are indispensable for clinicians in\nclinical settings. In response to these challenges, we scru-\ntinized the emerging role of LLM-powered autonomous\nagents in medicine, categorizing their applications and\nsummarizing prevailing evaluation methodologies.\nThrough this extensive analysis, we aimed to provide\na balanced and nuanced perspective on the current state\nof LLMs in medicine. In the contemporary landscape\nof LLM development, there is a discernible trend to-\nward harnessing LLMs specifically for the medical do-\nmain. While general-purpose LLMs exhibit remarkable\nproficiency, our observations suggest a strategic advan-\ntage in not directly fine-tuning them on specialized, long-\ntailed medical data. Instead, employing highly special-\nized expert models to handle such nuanced data, fol-\nlowed by storing the processed information in vector\ndatabases [20, 117], emerges as a promising paradigm.\nIn practice, querying this database can offer accurate\nand domain-specific insights. This approach not only\npresents a potential solution to the ”hallucination” phe-\nnomenon, where the models may fabricate inconsistent\nor outright false information, but also paves the way for\nintegration within an autonomous agent-based system,\nhinting at a comprehensive medical support system for\nthe future. Amidst these advancements, we emphasize\nthe potential of LLMs to revolutionize medical practice\nwhile underscoring the imperative for ethical vigilance\nand continuous scrutiny.\nThe integration of LLMs in the medical field necessi-\ntates a nuanced evaluation from both technological and\nmedical standpoints. From a technical perspective, the\nproficiency of LLMs in parsing and generating complex,\nnuanced language is crucial, particularly in understand-\ning and formulating medical terminology, patient narra-\ntives, and intricate case details. However, the efficacy of\nthese models hinges on their ability to handle sensitive in-\nformation ethically, maintain patient confidentiality, and\nnavigate the consequences of misinformation, requiring\nstrict accuracy benchmarks. For medical professionals,\nthe assessment revolves around the practical applicability\n14', 'low results. The reason is that these four LLMs are LLMs in the general domain, thus\nunderperforming in the medical diagnosis scenes.\nComparing the results of human evaluation and the automatic evaluation, the\nrelative performance of LLMs is consistent. Thus, the automatic evaluation could be\nutilized to evaluate the relative performance between two LLMs.\n3 Discussion\nUsing LLMs in clinical practice enhances diagnosis and treatment efficiency, and\nstudies have tried to evaluate the diagnostic ability of LLMs to that of physi-\ncians [21, 22]. However, the evaluations of LLMs’ performance were mainly based on\nthe word-based metrics, which is biased evaluation metrics, as shown in Table 1. For\nexample, researchers compare LLMs’ output with ground truths with ROUGE and\nBLEU [21, 23, 24], which ignore semantic information. To facilitate the application of\nLLMs in real clinical settings, we altered Mini-CEX, a scale used to judge diagnos-\ntic abilities of physicians, and built a comprehensive scale considering LLMs’ medical\ninterviewing skills, humanistic care, and diagnosis ability. Despite of the effectiveness,\nthe original Mini-CEX can not be directly applied to LLMs, due to a lack of physical\nobservations, palpations, and access to laboratory testing in text-based LLM dia-\nlogues. Therefore, modifications are needed to Mini-CEX in order to evaluate LLMs’\ndiagnostic skills, including the removal of items related to physical examinations and\nlaboratory tests as well as the simplification of complicated, repetitive, and ambiguous\nitems. Specifically, an expert committee was established to draft the LLMs-specific\nMini-CEX and the Delphi method was used for revision. Then, the reliability and\nvalidity analysis [18] are utilized to analyze the necessity and sufficiency of each item\nin the scale3. Finally, the LLM-specific Mini-CEX is obtained, containing 4 primary\nitems including medical interviewing skills ,humanistic care ,comprehensive diagnos-\ntic and treatment abilities , and overall clinical competence , with a total number of 26\nsecondary items. The reliability and validity of the scale were tested by Cronbach’s\nalpha coefficient, KMO test and Bartlett’s test for sphericity. The overall Cronbach’s\nalpha coefficient was 0.802, indicating great internal consistency of the scale. KMO\nvalue was 0.835 and the Bartlett’s test for sphericity was significant (0.000), suggest-\ning that the items in the scale effectively measure variables. Overall, the LLM-specific\nMini-CEX is suitable for evaluating LLMs’ diagnostic ability and can further promote\nthe application of LLMs in medical treatment scenarios.\nThis work also made an attempt to utilized an automatic evaluation to evaluate\nLLMs automatically, thus reducing labor costs, improving evaluation efficiency, and\nreducing potential bias in human evaluations. Previous works on automatic evaluations\nfocused on pairwise comparison [11, 14], aiming to judge the relative quality of two\nLLMs’ responses. However, the pairwise comparison can not provide single-answer\ngrading, hindering the application of LLMs in medical treatment scenarios. To alleviate\nthe issue, we developed a automatic evaluation to provide single-answer grading [12, 13]\nfor LLMs’ responses.

How do LLMs fare in analogical/moral reasoning vs. predicting object patterns?,"['Are LLMs the Master of All Trades? : Exploring Domain-Agnostic\nReasoning Skills of LLMs\nShrivats Agrawal\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nshriv9@seas.upenn.edu\nAbstract\nThe potential of large language models\n(LLMs) to reason like humans has been a\nhighly contested topic in Machine Learning\ncommunities.

The code devel-\noped for conducting these experiments can be\nfound here.\n1 Introduction\nWith the emergence of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) we have been able to achieve unprecedented\nperformance in Natural Language Processing tasksand have also enabled machines to generate human-\nlike text and perform complex language-based tasks\n(Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Brown\net al., 2020). However, with the rising difﬁculty in\ndistinguishing content generated by LLMs from that\nwritten by humans, the central question of whether\nLLMs can truly emulate human reasoning and per-\nform reasoning across a broad range of domains\nis now more relevant than ever. (Saparov and He,\n2023)\nAt the heart of every human cognitive activity like\nproblem solving and decision-making lies reasoning\nof some form. Yet, human reasoning is multifaceted\nand can be seen in diverse forms such as analogical,\nspatial, causal, and moral reasoning, among others\n(Johnson-Laird, 2010). Therefore, studying the ex-\ntent to which LLMs can perform equally well across\nthese different domains of reasoning is essential to\nadvancing our understanding of these models and\ntheir potential applications in real world settings.\nHumans have the ability to reason and under-\nstand things by using analogies, even when pre-\nsented with textual information alone (Goswami,\n1996). However, the development of spatial reason-\ning skills requires an approach driven by input from\nother senses, with humans needing to interact with\ntheir environment using senses like vision, sound,\nand touch. Meanwhile, moral reasoning abilities are\nprimarily shaped by a person’s education, experi-\nences, and surroundings. The clear differences be-\ntween these types of reasoning motivated me to fo-\ncus my attention and assess the reasoning abilities\nof LLMs on analogical, spatial, and moral reasoning\ntasks. My study employs a range of experimentalarXiv:2303.12810v1  [cs.CL]  22 Mar 2023', 'methods, including the use of existing datasets di-\nrectly, such as BATS (Gladkova et al., 2016), as well\nas constructing a toy dataset by drawing inspiration\nfrom SpartQA (Mirzaee et al., 2021) to directly eval-\nuate LLMs abilities in analogical and spatial reason-\ning. I also evaluate LLMs performance on more\nopen-ended, natural language questions that probe\ninto these reasoning domains, as well as moral rea-\nsoning. My ﬁndings reveal that LLMs exhibit im-\npressive capabilities in analogical and moral reason-\ning, yet face challenges in performing as proﬁciently\non spatial reasoning tasks.\n2 Experimental Setup\nThe experimental methodology for this paper is par-\ntitioned into three distinct sections, each pertaining\nto one of the three reasoning domains evaluated:\nanalogical reasoning, spatial reasoning, and moral\nreasoning.\n2.1 Analogical Reasoning\nTo evaluate LLMs’ analogical reasoning capabili-\nties, a subsection of the BATS dataset (Gladkova et\nal., 2016) is used along with free-form natural lan-\nguage questions gathered from the web and some\ncreated in-house. GPT-3 davinci-003 (Brown et al.,\n2020) is used for performing experiments with the\ncontrolled dataset and ChatGPT is used for conver-\nsational style natural language questions.\n2.1.1 Controlled Dataset\nAn experimental dataset is created for analogical\nreasoning by randomly sampling from the lexico-\ngraphic semantics portion of the BATS dataset. This\nsection of the dataset is chosen as previous models\nhave shown the least accuracy on this section and it\nis the hardest to solve as the analogies don’t follow\nany explicit grammatical rules. To ensure a uniform\nevaluation across the entire lexicographic section, 20\nrandom analogies are sampled from each of the 10\nsubﬁles of lexicographic semantics, resulting in a to-\ntal of 200 analogies. The task is framed as a cloze\nquestion test, where the model is required to ﬁll in\nthe blank. For instance, the model is prompted as\nfollows for one such example:\n“Fill in the blank: Sofa is to piece of furniture as\nstapler is to . Answer: ”\nThe models are evaluated by considering exact\nFigure 1: Spatial Reasoning: Visualization of Controlled\nDataset Example\nmatches in the set of provided answers as correct\nand incorrect otherwise.\n2.1.2 Conversational Prompts\nTo evaluate LLMs in a way similar to humans, I\ncollated a dataset containing free-form natural lan-\nguage questions. The dataset consists of questions\nlike“Explain how a camera works by taking the ex-\nample of an eye. ” and“How is electricity like ﬂow-\ning water?” . LLMs are qualitatively evaluated on\ntheir ability to provide a convincing answer.\n2.2 Spatial Reasoning\nA small experimental dataset is constructed by tak-\ning cues from SpartQA (Mirzaee et al., 2021). Ad-\nditionally, the model’s spatial reasoning capabilities\nare also evaluated using a comprehensive task with\nfollow up questions in a free-form conversational\nlanguage format. As before, GPT-3 davinici-003\nis used for experiments with the controlled dataset\nand ChatGPT is used for conversational style dataset\nwith follow up questions.\n2.2.1 Controlled Dataset\nThe spatial reasoning evaluation task is designed\nas a textual entailment task using a controlled\ndataset, which is constructed in-house following in-\nspiration from SpartQA. In this task, the model is\npresented with a textual description of three objects\nand then asked to predict whether a fourth described\nobject follows closely to the pattern of the three pre-\nvious shapes. The model’s response is constrained to\na True or False output which provides a clear metric\nfor evaluation. Figure 1 provides a visual example\nof the textually described problem. The model’s ac-\ncuracy is evaluated by the number of correct predic-\ntions.']","LLMs excel at analogical and moral reasoning, yet struggle to perform as proficiently on spatial reasoning tasks, such as predicting object patterns.",multi_context,"[{'page_label': '1', 'file_name': '2303.12810v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2303.12810v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 274480, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2303.12810v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2303.12810v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 274480, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True
How do top-k indices and activation patterns in the LLM factoscope model boost factual content detection?,"['from the differential areas within LLMs responsible for fac-\ntual information and creative output, leading to varying inter-\nnal state behaviors when producing factual versus non-factual\ncontent [10].\nBased on our preliminary observations that LLMs exhibit\ndistinct activation patterns when outputting factual versus\nnon-factual content, we introduce the LLM factoscope, a\nSiamese network-based factual detection model. The LLM\nfactoscope analyzes the inner states from LLMs, including\nactivation maps ,final output ranks ,top-k output indices , and\ntop-k output probabilities , each offering a unique perspective\non the model’s internal decision-making process. Activation\nmaps are utilized to understand information processing within\nthe LLM, highlighting the neurons actively generating fac-\ntual versus non-factual outputs. Concurrently, final output\nranks indicate the evolving likelihood of the final output token\nacross the layers, providing insights into the model’s shifting\noutput preferences. Additionally, top-k output indices iden-\ntify the most probable output tokens at each layer, reflecting\nthe model’s decision-making priorities and its process of nar-\nrowing down choices. Complementing these, top-k output\nprobabilities reveal the model’s confidence in its top choices\nat each layer, offering a window into its probabilistic reason-\ning. Together, these diverse inner states enable our LLM Fac-\ntoscope model to effectively discern the factual accuracy of\nLLM outputs, leveraging the nuanced insights provided by\neach type of intermediate data in a cohesive, integrated man-\nner.\nLLM factoscope assesses the factuality of the model’s\ncurrent output, providing a novel approach to fact-checking\nwithin LLMs. In our experiments, we empirically demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of the LLM factoscope across vari-\nous LLM architectures, including GPT2-XL-1.5b, Llama2-\n7b, Vicuna-7b, Stablelm-7b, Llama2-13b, and Vicuna-13b.\nThe LLM factoscope achieves an accuracy rate exceeding\n96% in factual detection. Additionally, we extensively exam-\nine the model’s generalization capabilities and conduct abla-\ntion studies to understand the impact of different sub-models\nand support set sizes on the LLM factoscope’s performance.\nOur work paves a new path for utilizing inner states from\nLLMs for factual detection, sparking further exploration and\nanalysis of LLMs’ inner data for enhanced model understand-\ning and reliability. Our contributions are as follows:\n• We designed a pipeline for LLM factoscope, encompass-\ning factual data collection, creation of a factual detection\ndataset, model architecture design, and detailed training\nand testing procedures. All the datasets and implemen-\ntation will be released for further research and analysis.\n• We empirically validated the effectiveness of LLM fac-\ntoscope, explored its generalizability across various do-\nmains, and conducted thorough ablation experiments to\nunderstand the influence of different model components\nand parameters settings.\n2 Background\n2.1 Large Language Models\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), predominantly structured\naround the transformer decoder architecture [11]. Thesemodels, typically comprising billions of parameters, are adept\nat capturing intricate language patterns [12]. A formalized\nview of their inner workings can be presented as follows:\nConsider an LLM defined as a function Fmapping an input\nsequence x= (x1, x2, . . . , x n)to an output sequence y=\n(y1, y2, . . . , y m), where xandyconsist of tokens from a pre-\ndefined vocabulary V. Each token xiis first transformed into\na high-dimensional space through an embedding layer, result-\ning in a sequence of embeddings E=Embed (x). The core of\nan LLM lies in its multiple layers of transformers, each com-\nprising two main components: a self-attention module Aand\na multilayer perceptron (MLP) module M. For a given layer\nl, the hidden state H(l−1)(withH(0)=E) is first processed\nby the self-attention mechanism. The output of the attention\nlayer, denoted as A(l), is then passed through the MLP layer.\nThe MLP, a series of fully connected layers, further processes\nthis data to produce the output, denoted as M(l). The pro-\ncess within each layer can be mathematically represented as:\nA(l)=A(H(l−1)),M(l)=M(A(l),H(l−1)),H(l)=\nH(l−1)+A(l)+M(l),where AandMencapsulate the op-\nerations within the attention and MLP, respectively. After the\nfinal layer L, the output H(L)is typically passed through\na linear layer followed by a softmax function to generate a\nprobability distribution over the vocabulary Vfor each token\nin the output sequence: y=softmax (W·H(L)+b), where\nWandbare the weights and bias of the linear layer, respec-\ntively. Our method leverages inner states from the LLM, such\nas output from the hidden layer and MLP module, to detect\nwhether the next output of the LLM is factual or not.\n2.2 LLM Factual Detection\nFact-checking LLM outputs has become an increasingly crit-\nical task. Current approaches to mitigate LLM-generated in-\naccuracies include scrutinizing training datasets and cross-\nreferencing external databases. Manual examination [13]of\ntraining datasets is labor-intensive, while external database\nreferencing [14] [15]incurs additional computational costs\nand relies heavily on the effectiveness of cross-verification\ntechniques. A recently proposed SAPLMA [16]investigates\nwhether LLMs can discern the factuality of an input sentence.\nThey use output from a single layer of LLM to train a fully\nconnected neural network. Our method aims to distinguish\neach output as factual or non-factual, closely emulating the\ntypical usage of LLMs. We leverage not just activation val-\nues from a single layer, but also the inter-layer changes in\nactivations and hidden states within the LLM. This multi-\ndimensional analysis of the LLM’s inner data is akin to ob-\nserving various physiological responses in a human lie detec-\ntor[8]. By aggregating these intermediate states, our method\nprovides a more effective, generalized, and explainable tool\nfor analyzing the factual accuracy of the LLM’s output.\n2.3 Siamese Network\nSiamese Networks are designed to address few-shot learning\nchallenges by discerning the similarities and differences be-\ntween input pairs rather than conventional classification [17].\nThese networks consist of two identical sub-networks with\nshared weights, ensuring uniform processing of inputs.

[293] explore whether the internal\nknowledge of LLMs can replace the retrieved documents on knowledge-intensive tasks. They ask\nLLMs, such as InstructGPT, to directly generate contexts given a question rather than retrieving\nthem from the database. They find the generated documents contain the golden answers more\noften than the top retrieved documents. Then they feed the generated docs and retrieved docs to\nthe Fusion-in-Decoder model [ 109] for knowledge-intensive tasks such as Open-domain QA [ 128]\nand find the generated docs are more effective than the retrieved docs, suggesting that the LLMs\ncontain enough knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.\nOn the contrary, these observations have been contested in subsequent investigations. Kandpal\net al. [121] underscore the dependency of LLMs on the number of associated documents seen during\npre-training. They argue that the success in answering fact-based questions is highly linked to the\nnumber of documents containing the topic of the question that were encountered in pre-training.\nThe study further posited the necessity of scaling models extensively to achieve competitive\nperformance for questions with minimum representation in the training data. Adding to these\nconcerns, Sun et al . [239] critically evaluate the factual knowledge base of LLMs, using a specifically\ndesigned Head-to-Tail benchmark comprised of 18K question-answer pairs. The results show that\nthe understanding of factual knowledge, particularly related to torso-to-tail entities, by currently\navailable LLMs is suboptimal.\nIn summary, while LLMs show promise in handling knowledge-intensive tasks, their dependency\non pre-training information and limitations in factual accuracy remain significant hurdles. It\nunderscores the need for further advancements in the field and the importance of incorporating\ncomplementary methods, such as retrieval augmentation, to enhance the learning of long-tail\nknowledge in LLMs.\n4.1.3 Contextual Influence and Knowledge Conflict. This sub-subsection examines the interplay\nbetween an LLM’s inherent parametric knowledge and the provided contextual knowledge, explor-\ning both the model’s capacity to utilize context and its behavior when confronted with conflicting\ninformation.\nContextual Influence on Generation. Some works explore the model’s capacity to utilize context,\nfor example, Li et al . [135] observe that larger models tend to rely on their parametric knowledge,\neven when faced with counterfactual contexts. This suggests that as models increase in size, they\nmight grow more confident in their internal knowledge, potentially sidelining external context.\nHowever, the introduction of irrelevant contexts can still influence their outputs.

Which OpenEval dimension has the fewest datasets?,"['knowledge-oriented Chinese benchmarks, e.g., C-\nEval (Huang et al., 2023), M3KE (Liu et al., 2023),\nand CMMLU (Li et al., 2023a), have been recently\ndeveloped to evaluate the knowledge capturing and\nunderstanding of Chinese LLMs over a wide range\nof subjects within the Chinese education system.\nIn addition to these benchmarks that aims at eval-\nuating a specific aspect of LLMs, efforts have been\nalso explored to build Chinese LLM evaluation\nplatforms that attempt to comprehensively evalu-\nate LLMs with a suite of benchmarks. FlagEval\n(Contributors, 2023a) is a multilingual and mul-\ntimodal evaluation platform that includes bench-\nmarks for NLP and computer vision (CV) tasks\nin Chinese and English. OpenCompass (Contribu-\ntors, 2023b) is an evaluation platform designed for\nChinese LLMs. It presents a varied range of bench-\nmarks covering reading comprehension, question\nanswering, reasoning, and more, enabling a thor-\nough evaluation of LLM capabilities in Chinese\nNLP tasks. CLEV A (Li et al., 2023c) is a recent\nplatform introduced for comprehensive evaluation\nof Chinese LLMs. Like OpenCompass, its goal is\nto offer a broad suite of benchmarks for assessing\nChinese LLMs across various language understand-\ning and generation tasks. In contrast to these ef-\nforts, OpenEval not only evaluates the capability\nand alignment of Chinese LLMs, but also assesses\nthe safety issue associated with advanced LLMs,\nleading to a more comprehensive evaluation.\n3 Data Pre-processing and\nPost-processing\nLLMs have shown impressive performance across\nmultiple tasks when provided with instructions.\nAs a result, we have included a specific prompt\nfor each task based on the corresponding task de-\nscription. Examples of prompts are shown in Ap-\npendix B.\nIn the current version of OpenEval, we collect 25\ndatasets and further split them into 53 tasks. Ulti-\nmately, around 300K questions have been reformu-\nlated in a unified form using appropriate prompts\nfor the zero-shot evaluation setting. Users can also\nmodify the prompts by themselves, as different\nLLMs use different prompts that are defined dur-\ning their fine-tuning stage. Notably, the evalua-\ntion dimension that consists of the largest num-\nber of datasets and tasks is capability. Conversely,\nsafety is the evaluation dimension with the smallest\nnumber of datasets, indicating a lack of availabledatasets for assessing LLMs’ safety.\nLLMs may not strictly adhere to user instruc-\ntions. For instance, in a multiple-choice QA task,\neven being instructed to only predict the final op-\ntion without additional explanations, some LLMs\nmay still generate surplus content that contradicts\nthe measurement metric, such as accuracy. Hence,\nwe offer task-specific answer selection methods in\nOpenEval based on their metric descriptions. For\nexample, in a multiple-choice QA task, we choose\nthe first uppercase letter from the LLM output as\nthe final answer.\n4 Evaluation Taxonomy\nInspired by Guo et al. (2023), we design an eval-\nuation taxonomy with three major dimensions for\nOpenEval, which are capability, alignment, and\nsafety, as illustrated in Figure 1. This indicates that\nOpenEval not only focuses on LLMs’ proficiency\nin traditional NLP tasks but also measures to what\nextend LLMs align with human values and tend\ntowards undesirable behaviors. In essence, we en-\nvision OpenEval having the potential to monitor\nadvanced LLMs along their evolvement.\n4.1 Capabitity\nFor capability evaluation, OpenEval currently\ncovers benchmarks over NLP tasks, disciplinary\nknowledge, commonsense reasoning, and mathe-\nmatical reasoning.\nNLP tasks evaluation aims to test LLMs’ abili-\nties in various Chinese NLP tasks, including read-\ning comprehension (Jing et al., 2019), question\nanswering (Zeng, 2019; Sun et al., 2020a), text\ngeneration (Ge et al., 2021), idiom understanding\n(Zheng et al., 2019), text entailment (Xu et al.,\n2020), and connective word understanding (Bench-\nmark, 2020).\nDisciplinary knowledge evaluation (Liu et al.,\n2023) assesses how well LLMs answer questions\ncollected from human examinations according to\nthe main Chinese educational system, which are\nranging from primary school to career exams, in-\ncluding Art & Humanities, Social Science, Nature\nScience, and other subjects related to Chinese cul-\nture.\nCommonsense reasoning evaluation (He et al.,\n2021; Ge et al., 2022; He et al., 2020; Shi et al.,\n2023) focuses on assessing whether LLMs can iden-\ntify commonsense errors and have the capability to\nunderstand implied knowledge through common\n3']",The OpenEval dimension with the fewest datasets is safety.,reasoning,"[{'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '2403.12316v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2403.12316v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1782361, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

Almost all two-\nstage methods experience a significant decrease in VES. It can be attributed to the possibility of LLMs\noptimizing the correct SQL statements into incorrect ones, thereby resulting in a further decrease in\naccuracy. Even when considering only the correct results, the performance improvement in terms of\nexecution efficiency brought by the optimized SQL statements is almost negligible. Furthermore, it\nis intriguing to note that directly instructing the LLM to generate efficient SQL statements appears\nto achieve improved accuracy. This suggests that placing higher demands on the LLM could yield\nsurprisingly positive outcomes.\nCore Conclusion 6.

By\nconverting the generated SQL statements back into text and juxtaposing these with the semantics of\nthe original user questions, we can assess the accuracy of the SQL statements produced. In addition,\nit can assist researchers in evaluating the semantic comprehension capabilities of different LLMs,\nthus facilitating the development of more effective Text-to-SQL methodologies.\nTo this end, we assess the performance of SQL-to-Text across different LLMs (See Appendix A.4 for\nprompt templates). The selected metrics for evaluation encompass the F1 values of Rouge-1/2/L and\nBertScore, along with the application of LLM to assess the semantic coherence between the two texts.\nThe evaluation results are depicted in Table 7.

How does the WoW dataset help replace a human wizard with an LLM?,"['4% over the 0-shot LLM query, while our approach\ndemonstrates a nearly 20% increase over the 0-shot\nLLM\nA dataset commonly used for training and fine-\ntuning LLMs is the Wizard-of-Wikipedia (Dinan\net al., 2018). The Wizard-of-Wikipedia dataset in-\ncludes interactions between a human apprentice\nand a human wizard. The human wizard receives\nrelevant Wikipedia articles, which should be used\nto select a relevant sentence and compose the re-\nsponse. The goal is to replace the wizard with a\nlearned agent (such as an LLM). Another highly\nrelevant dataset is FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018,\n2019). The FEVER dataset is designed for devel-\noping models that receive as input a claim and a\npassage, and must determine whether the passage\nsupports the claim, refutes it, or does not provide\nenough information to support or refute it. While\nthe FEVER dataset is highly relevant, it does not\nprovide simple sentence that are clearly true or\nfalse independently of a provided passage. In ad-\ndition, the FEVER dataset is not partitioned into\ndifferent topics as the true-false dataset provided in\nthis paper.\nIn conclusion, while several approaches have\nbeen proposed to address the problem of halluci-\nnation and inaccuracy in automatically generated\ncontent, our work is unique in its focus on utilizing\nthe LLM’s hidden layer activations to determine\nthe veracity of generated statements. Our method\noffers the potential for more general applicability in\nreal-world scenarios, operating alongside an LLM,\nwithout the need for fine-tuning or task-specific\nmodifications.\n3 The True-False Dataset\nThe work presented in this paper requires a dataset\nof true and false statements. These statements must\nhave a clear true or false label, and must be based\non information present in the LLM’s training data.\nFurthermore, since our approach intends to reveal\nthat the hidden states of an LLM have a notion of\na statement being true or false, the dataset must\ncover several disjoint topics, such that a classifier\ncan be trained on the LLM’s activations of some\ntopics while being tested on another. Unfortunately,\nwe could not find any such dataset and therefore,\ncompose the true-false dataset.\nOur true-false dataset covers the following top-\nics: “Cities"", “Inventions"", “Chemical Elements"",\n“Animals"", “Companies"", and “Scientific Facts"".For the first 5 topics, we used the following method\nto compose the dataset. We used a reliable source1\nthat included a table with several properties for\neach instance. For example, for the “chemical el-\nements"" we used a table that included, for each\nelement, its name, atomic number, symbol, stan-\ndard state, group block, and a unique property (e.g.,\nHydrogen, 1, H, Gas, Nonmetal, the most abun-\ndant element in the universe). For each element we\ncomposed true statement using the element name\nand one of its properties (e.g., “The atomic number\nof Hydrogen is 1”). Then, we randomly selected a\ndifferent row for composing a false statement (e.g.,\n“The atomic number of Hydrogen is 34”). If the\nvalue in the different row is identical to the value in\nthe current row, we resample a different row until\nwe obtain a value that is different. This process\nwas repeated for the all topics except the “Scien-\ntific Facts”. For the “Scientific Facts” topic, we\nasked ChatGPT (Feb 13 version) to provide “sci-\nentific facts that are well known to humans” (e.g.\n“The sky is often cloudy when it’s going to rain”).\nWe then asked ChatGPT to provide the opposite of\neach statement such that it becomes a false state-\nment (e.g., “The sky is often clear when it’s going\nto rain”). The statements provided by ChatGPT\nwere manually curated, and verified by two hu-\nman annotators. The classification of 48 facts were\nquestioned by at least one of the annotators; these\nfacts were removed from the dataset. The true-\nfalse dataset comprises 6,084 sentences, including\n1,458 sentences for “Cities"", 876 for “Inventions"",\n930 for “Chemical Elements"", 1,008 for “Animals"",\n1,200 for “Companies"", and 612 for “Scientific\nFacts"". The following are some examples of true\nstatements from the dataset:\n• Cities: “Oranjestad is a city in Aruba”\n•Inventions: “Grace Hopper invented the\nCOBOL programming language”\n• Animals: “The llama has a diet of herbivore”\n•Companies: “Meta Platforms has headquar-\nters in United States”\n•Scientific Facts: “The Earth’s tides are pri-\nmarily caused by the gravitational pull of the\nmoon”\nThe following are some examples of false state-\nments from the dataset:\n1Cities: Downloaded from simplemaps.

How does SLAM-ASR align speech & text?,"['encoder with Qwen-2B (Bai et al., 2023) for end-\nto-end training for multiple speech and audio\ntasks, with full parameter fine-tuning performed.\nSpeechGPT (Zhang et al., 2023) discretizes speech\ntokens with HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021) and fine-\ntunes the LLaMA-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a) with\nmultiple stages.

Detection performance of the watermarked text under word substitution attacks.\n5.3. Word Substitution Attacks\nWe conduct a study to understand the robustness of our\nmethod under substitution attacks. One of the unique ad-\nvantages of our method, compared to the fixed-model ap-\nproaches, is our watermark can be adapted to different\nnewly discovered attacks, in the style of adversarial train-\ning (Madry et al., 2017).\nTo perform the substitution attack, we randomly replace\na fraction of tokens in the response with random tokens\nfrom the vocabulary, and then see if watermarks can still\nbe detected or not. In addition, we include our method\nwhen combined with adversarial training. Specifically, we\ngenerate substituted responses on the training set, used as\nthe adversarial examples, as the training samples used in our\nRL pipeline. In other words, when we train the detector θd,\nwe label the substituted response, f(x;θw) + ∆ where ∆is\nthe substitution perturbations, as still watermarked. We then\ntest if the detector’s ability to identify substituted responses\nas watermarked in the training set can generalize to the\nunseen test set.\nWe show the results in Figure 2 and include the numbers\nin Table 7 of Appendix B. Unsurprisingly, ITS and EXP\noutperform us because they are designed to be robust against\nword substitutions (Kuditipudi et al., 2023). However, when\nwe incorporate adversarial examples into our training, we\ncan achieve much stronger robustness, especially when the\nsubstitution ratio is high – we can achieve almost no AUC\nloss even when substituting 50% tokens.\n5.4. Paraphrasing Attacks\nWe evaluate the robustness of our method under paraphras-\ning attacks. We paraphrase responses by two paraphrasing\nmodels: Pegasus (Zhang et al., 2019) and DIPPER (Krishna\net al., 2023). Similarly in Section 5.3, we incorporate the\nparaphrased responses as the watermarked text into our train-ing in the style of adversarial attack. Paraphrasing strength\nin Pegasus is quantified by temperature T, and we evaluate\natT= 1.0,1.5,2.0. Paraphrasing strength in DIPPER is\nquantified by diversity qfor both lexical diversity and order\ndiversity, and we evaluate at q= 20,40,60.\nFigure 3 shows the results w.r.t. Pegasus. The full results\nare in Table 8 in Appendix C. Unlike substitution attacks,\nour method can already achieve decent robustness against\nparaphrasing and outperform the baselines even when the\nparaphrasing strength is low. It is because token-level meth-\nods are known to be vulnerable to paraphrasing while our\nmodel-level approach watermarks the response not based\non replacing specific tokens, but modifying the response as\na whole, therefore the change we induce is at the semantic\nlevel, which is less vulnerable to paraphrasing. In addi-\ntion, similar to substitution attacks, our method can achieve\nstronger robustness by adversarial training.\nFigure 4 shows the robustness of the LLM adversarially\ntrained on Pegasus-paraphrased responses and tested on\nDIPPER-paraphrased responses. The full results are in Ta-\nble 9 in Appendix C. We can see that finetuning the LLM\nwith Pegasus attacks can also improve the robustness against\nDIPPER attacks, showing the flexibility to incorporate new\nattacks into the watermarks, which is a feature that fixed-\nmodel approaches have no feasible way to provide.\n5.5. Detecting Text Generated by Another LLM\nSo far, all the non-watermarked text used in our framework\nis generated by humans (i.e. existing responses in C4 and\nPKU datasets). We now test if our framework can detect the\ntext generated by another LLM.\nWe test our previously trained LLM, which is fine-tuned\non human-written text and named as Ours (H), using text\ngenerated by another LLM. We use OPT-1.3B generated\ntext as the test data on the watermarked model designed\n6']","Adversarial training enhances watermark robustness against both substitution and paraphrasing attacks.

For paraphrasing attacks, adversarial training also improves robustness, with the model showing decent robustness against paraphrasing and outperforming baselines even at low paraphrasing strengths.

How does strategic reasoning link to long-term payoff?,"['Preview\nprompts, otherwise, it might be difficult to filter out if the action was chosen because one wants to\nwin at all cost, or one is simply being irrational.\nA.3.2 S TRATEGIC REASONING ABILITY\nIn competitive games, we can expect agents to be playing the NE strategies when there is common\nknowledge of rationality. However, when it is possible that opponents are not completely rational,\nthe rational strategy might not necessarily be the winning strategy. As a result, in order to gain the\nhighest payoff, a player would need to reason about the strategies of other players, which we defined\nto be their strategic reasoning ability. Given historical information, we expect that models who are\ncapable of strategic reasoning to show timely adaption to the strategies of other players to avoid loss\nor even increase payoff. The higher payoffs one is able to obtain over time, the better one is able to\nform correct beliefs about other players’ strategies, and thus the greater is one’s strategic reasoning\nability. We define a similar metric as the measure in 1\nri=1\nTPT\nt=1ρ(ˆait)\nρop(4)\nwhere ˆaitis the action chosen by agent iat time stamp t(with history given); ρ(ˆait)equals to payoff\nafter the action ˆait;ρoprefers to optimal payoff of the respective game; Tindicates the total time;\nrirefers to the ratio of average payoff of agent iover total time Tto the optimal payoff. The closer\nthe distance between the ratio and 1, the better the strategic reasoning ability.\nIn order to further distinguish the level of LLMs’ strategic reasoning ability, we vary the complete-\nness of historical information3mainly in two ways:\n1) Only the strategies of other players in the past games (applies to both game types)\n2) Provides the private information along with the strategies of other players in the past games\n(applies to the auction games)\nOur assumption is that the more information is revealed, the agent with stronger strategic reasoning\nability is more likely to win. Since the beauty contest game has a more simplified setting, it is\nanticipated that by showing the strategies of other players, it would be sufficient to distinguish the\nstronger player. Whereas for the auction games, they are more complex, thus more information\nmight be necessary for better identification, on the other hand, insufficient information may mislead\nLLMs to pursue wrong strategies.\nMoreover, we take irrational behaviours (i.e. overbids) as well as bad strategies (i.e. miscalculations)\ninto account and suggest that a model with good strategic reasoning ability may not obtain high\nexpected payoffs due to such factors. As a result, we also make use of self-competing games,\nand specifically inform LLMs that all the players are of similar level of rationality and strategic\nreasoning ability. By force of contrast, we could potentially deduce which models are the ones that\nshould have received higher payoffs when there are less unfavourable factors. Meanwhile, in self-\ncompeting beauty contest game, we can observe whether the curve of respective LLM’s strategies\nconverges to the NE in order to further verify their strategic reasoning ability.\n3The history is not necessarily in the same session of the games, details will be specified in the experimental\nsetting\n22']","Strategic reasoning is linked to long-term payoff as it involves reasoning about the strategies of other players to avoid loss or increase payoff.

In addition,\nambiguous and superficial questions posed by users\nmight steer the model towards generating unrelated,\nimplausible, or bizarre output (Rawte et al., 2023a).\nIn this part, we continue to analyze the effect of\nprompt design on LLM hallucinations.\nPrompt Design. Generally, a prompt contains task\ndescription, input question, and contextual infor-\nmation such as in-context demonstrations (Santu\nand Feng, 2023). Here, we experiment with several\nprompt designs by varying the three ingredients:\n•Base prompt : the initial prompt with a simple\ntask description and input question.\n•Manual description prompt : manually rewrit-\ning the task description in base prompt.\n•Synthetic description prompt : using ChatGPT\nto synthesize the task description in base prompt.\n•Refined question prompt : refining the initial\nquestion in base prompt by ChatGPT.\n•Manual in-context prompt : manually selecting\nfive in-context demonstrations for the base prompt.\n•Retrieved in-context prompt : retrieving demon-\nstrations based on BERT similarity from HaluEval\n2.0 (besides the 1,000 test samples).\n•Synthetic in-context prompt : using ChatGPT\nto synthesize the in-context demonstrations.\n•Reverse prompt : reversing the position of taskdescription and input question in base prompt ( i.e.,\nplace the task description after the input question).\nWe feed these prompts into ChatGPT and Llama\n2-Chat (7B) and the evaluation results are shown\nin Table 6. First, we can observe that rewriting\nthe task description with more details can reduce\nthe hallucinations to some extent, while this effect\nis varied in domains. For professional domains\n(i.e.,biomedicine and science), incorporating more\ndetails into the task description can mitigate some\nhallucinations. Second, leveraging in-context learn-\ning can also help eliminate hallucinations in LLM’s\nresponses. These examplars or demonstrations can\nbe manually selected, retrieved from candidate cor-\npus, or automatically generated by LLM itself. It\nis noting that MaHR and MiHR are not strongly\npositively correlated, where the two metrics mea-\nsure the hallucination degree from distinct levels.\nFinally, in most cases, rewriting the question or\nplacing the task description at the end of the input\nquestion will instead hurt the model performance\nand induces more hallucinations.\nQuestion Content. Following prior work (Rawte\net al., 2023a), we further delve into how linguistics\nof question content, specifically readability, formal-\nity, and concreteness, influence the occurrence of\nLLM hallucinations. Readability quantifies the ex-\ntent to which the question can be understood by\nhumans; Formality refers to the degree of appro-\npriate tone and professionalism conveyed by the\nchoice of words, grammatical structure, style, etc.;']",Rewriting the task description with more details can reduce the hallucinations to some extent in professional domains like biomedicine and science.,reasoning,"[{'page_label': '10', 'file_name': '2401.03205v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2401.03205v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 962304, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

How do LLMs boost BO in material discovery?,"['A Sober Look at LLMs for Material Discovery:\nAre They Actually Good for Bayesian Optimization Over Molecules?\nAgustinus Kristiadi1Felix Strieth-Kalthoff2Marta Skreta2Pascal Poupart3 1Al´an Aspuru-Guzik2 1\nGeoff Pleiss4 1\nAbstract\nAutomation is one of the cornerstones of contem-\nporary material discovery. Bayesian optimization\n(BO) is an essential part of such workflows, en-\nabling scientists to leverage prior domain knowl-\nedge into efficient exploration of a large molecu-\nlar space. While such prior knowledge can take\nmany forms, there has been significant fanfare\naround the ancillary scientific knowledge encap-\nsulated in large language models (LLMs). How-\never, existing work thus far has only explored\nLLMs for heuristic materials searches. Indeed,\nrecent work obtains the uncertainty estimate—an\nintegral part of BO—from point-estimated, non-\nBayesian LLMs. In this work, we study the ques-\ntion of whether LLMs are actually useful to ac-\ncelerate principled Bayesian optimization in the\nmolecular space. We take a sober, dispassionate\nstance in answering this question. This is done\nby carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature ex-\ntractors for standard but principled BO surrogate\nmodels and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient\nfinetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks\nto obtain the posterior of the LLM surrogate. Our\nextensive experiments with real-world chemistry\nproblems show that LLMs can be useful for BO\nover molecules, but only if they have been pre-\ntrained or finetuned with domain-specific data.\n1. Introduction\nMaterial discovery describes the inherently laborious, iter-\native process of designing materials candidates, preparing\nthem experimentally, testing their properties, and eventually\nupdating the initial design hypothesis (de Regt, 2020; Green-\naway et al., 2023).

Major challenges associated with\nthe discovery process are the complex and black box-like\nmapping between a material’s structure and its properties, as\nwell as the vastness of the design space (Wang et al., 2023).\nTo address the aforementioned problems, Bayesian opti-\nmization (BO; Mo ˇckus, 1975) has been increasingly used in\nchemistry (Griffiths et al., 2023; Hickman et al., 2023). Key\ncomponents of successful BO include its priors (informative\npriors imply efficient posterior inference with limited data)\nand its probabilistic surrogate models (e.g. via Gaussian pro-\ncesses (Rasmussen & Williams, 2005; Snoek et al., 2012)\nor Bayesian neural networks (Kim et al., 2022; Li et al.,\n2023; Kristiadi et al., 2023)). The probabilistic formulation\nof BO is useful since optimizing a black-box function is\nan inherently uncertain problem—we do not know a priori\nthe form of that function and our approximation of it might\nbe imprecise. Uncertainty-aware surrogate models are thus\nuseful to quantify the inherent uncertainty surrounding the\noptimization landscape, allowing for principled approaches\nto the exploration-exploitation tradeoff (Garnett, 2023).\nHowever good priors needed for constructing accurate un-\ncertainty estimates are hard to define analytically.

What are common AI misuse breaches in computing education?,"['2 Michael Sheinman Orenstrakh, Oscar Karnalim, Carlos Aníbal Suárez, and Michael Liut\nAlthough Artificial Intelligence (AI) can foster education [ 9], it might be misused to breach academic integrity.\nParaphrasing tools [ 40] and code obfuscation tools [ 2] for example, are misused to cover up evidence for plagiarism (a\nbreach of academic integrity about copying one’s work and reusing it without proper acknowledgment [14]).\nMisuse of AI chatbots with large language models (LLM) [ 6] such as ChatGPT1is another trending threat for\nbreaching academic integrity. Students can complete exams or assessments with limited effort, resulting in questionable\nperformance; it is unclear whether the learning objectives are actually met. The misuse can be considered as contract\ncheating (i.e., getting help in exchange for mutual incentives [ 27]) since AI chatbots provide responses in exchange for\nadditional user data. However, considering AI responses are generated based on other people’s textual data without\nproper acknowledgment, we believe it is more justifiable to consider the misuse as plagiarism.\nWhile checking student work for plagiarism, instructors are often aided by automated detectors. A number of\ndetectors have been developed to detect whether a work is a result of LLM. Two of them are GPT-2 Output Detector [ 50]\nand Giant Language model Test Room (GLTR) [ 16]. Nevertheless, due to the recency of misuse of AI chatbots, Computing\neducators might have limited information about publicly available detection detectors. Further, it is challenging to\nchoose the most suitable detector for their teaching environment. To the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical\nstudies comparing the detectors in terms of effectiveness.\nIn response to the aforementioned gaps, we investigate LLM-generated text detectors and formulate the following\nresearch question (RQ): “How effective are LLM-generated text detectors?”\nIt is clear that there is a need in the community to understand if the currently available detectors are able to detect\nLLM-generated content [37, 45, 52] and what there reliability is.\nAs an additional contribution, we also report our experience in using the LLM-generated text detectors. It might be\nuseful for readers interested in employing those detectors in their classrooms.\n2 RELATED WORK\nThis section discusses common breaches of academic integrity in computing education and misuse of AI to breach\nacademic integrity.\n2.1 Common Breaches of Academic Integrity\nAcademic integrity encourages students to act honestly, trustworthy, respectfully, and responsibly in learning2. Lancaster\n[25] lists five common breaches of academic integrity in computing education: plagiarism, collusion, contract cheating,\nexam cheating, and research fraud. It is important to inform students about instructors’ expectations about academic\nintegrity in their courses [49] and penalize those who breach academic integrity.\nPlagiarism happens when ideas, words, or even code is reused without proper acknowledgment and permission to\nthe original author(s) [ 14]. It is commonly identified with the help of automated detectors [ 3] such as Turnitin3, Lichen\n[38], MOSS4, and JPlag [ 39]. Any submissions with high similarity will be investigated and if they are indeed a result of\nmisconduct, the students will be penalized [20].\nNevertheless, identifying plagiarism is not always straightforward; some perpetrators disguise their act with auto-\nmated paraphrasing [ 23,40], essay spinning [ 26] or code obfuscation [ 2]. The automated detectors should be resilient to\ncommon disguising practices in addition to being effective and efficient. GPlag [ 29] and BPlag [ 8] for examples, focus on\n1https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\n2https://lo.unisa.edu.au/course/view.php?id=6751&amp;section=6\n3https://www.turnitin.com/\n4https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/\nManuscript submitted to ACM', '4 Michael Sheinman Orenstrakh, Oscar Karnalim, Carlos Aníbal Suárez, and Michael Liut\nAI chatbots [ 34], especially those with Large Language Model (LLM) [ 6] are intended to help people searching\ninformation, but they are misused to unethically complete exams10and assessments11. LLM is derived from Language\nModel (LM), a statistical model at which each sequence of words are assigned with a probability [ 11]. Per query or\nquestion, the response is generated by concatenating sequences of words that have high probability with the query or\nthe question.\nChatGPT is a popular example of LLM. The tool is developed by OpenAI, a non-profit American research laboratory\non top of GPT-3, a LLM with deep learning to generate human-like text. The tool relies on reinforcement and supervised\nlearning to further tune the model.\nA number of automated detectors have been developed to help instructors identifying AI misuses for breaching\nacademic integrity. In the context of plagiarism and collusion, automated detectors nullify common alterations that can\nbe done without understanding the content [ 24,43] and remove contents that are not evident for raising suspicion [ 48].\nIn dealing with misuses of AI chatbots, a few automated detectors are developed under the same way as the chatbots\nvia pretrained model, but dedicated to detect AI-generated texts. GPT-2 Output Detector [ 50] and GLTR [ 16] are two of\nthe examples.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nThis section discusses how the research question stated in the introduction would be addressed and our preliminary\nwork to discover publicly available LLM-generated text detectors.\nWe collected historical assignment data dating back to 2016 from two publicly funded research-focused institutions,\none in North America and one in South America. The data collected was from upper-year undergraduate computer\nscience and engineering students.\nWe analyzed a total of 164submissions ( 124were submitted by humans, 30were generated using ChatGPT, and\n10were generated by ChatGPT and altered using the Quillbot paraphrasing tool) and compared them against eight\nLLM-generated text detectors. This results in a total of 1,312prediction results.\nOf the 164submissions, 134were written in English ( 20of which were generated by a LLM, and another 10which\nwere LLM-generated and paraphrased) and 20were written in Spanish ( 10of which were AI-generated). The submissions\nwere collected between 2016 and 2018 (prior to the release of ChatGPT), and were made in “databases”, “networking”,\nand a “final thesis project” course. These courses were specifically selected as they are upper-year computer science\nmajor courses that touch on a mix of systems and theory (databases and networking), as well as technical writing in\ncomputer science with a programming/development component (final thesis project). The students in these courses\nwere primarily in a computer science major. It should also be noted that Spanish was selected as an alternative language\nto analyse because it is one of the world’s most popular languages, and some of the authors have experience writing\nand evaluating technical material in this language.\nThe assessments analyzed in this study (see Table 1) are taken from three undergrad courses. The first course is a\ndatabases course offered to third-year computer science students in their first or second semester. It is a mix of database\ntheory and practical systems application. There are 101paper submissions from this course which involved a final\nassessment where students wrote a report analyzing two industry players and their use of databases and data centers,\nthis was written in English.\n10https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/26/tech/chatgpt-passes-exams/index.html\n11https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-students-could-use-ai-to-cheat-but-its-a-chance-to-rethink-assessment-altogether-198019\nManuscript submitted to ACM']","Common AI misuse breaches in computing education include the use of paraphrasing tools and code obfuscation tools to cover up evidence of plagiarism, and the misuse of AI chatbots with large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT to complete exams or assessments with limited effort, resulting in questionable performance.",reasoning,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1316032, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}, {'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2307.07411v1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1316032, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

How does Flexgen's 4-bit compression boost GPT inference?,"['3) Impact of λon System Performance and Reliability:\nAs the parameter λin the Zipf distribution increases, shorter\nrequests are likely. This effect is evident in Figure 17. Both\nmodels exhibit a slight decline in system throughput and\nan increase in average and p90 latency. These observations\nsuggest that minor variations in the Zipf distribution have a less\npronounced effect on inference performance than concurrency’s\nimpact. Additionally, this relative insensitivity to changes in\nthe Zipf distribution could be attributed to the small sizes of\nthe models and their limited overall context length.\nOverall, minor changes in the parameter αor the CV\ncan lead to sudden request failures, significantly undermining\nthe system’s reliability. However, these changes have less\neffect on system performance metrics such as average latency\nand throughput. This is because such changes in αare\ntemporary and behave as quadratic functions. In contrast,\nalterations in αin a linear decline lead to ongoing performance\ndegradation, particularly noticeable during request failures.\nThese findings underscore the value of our trace analysis and\nprovide essential insights for improving system efficiency in\nsimilar computational environments.\nVI. D ISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThis work aims to analyze and elucidate the patterns observed\nin GPT Serving traces. To our knowledge, this represents\nthe first study of concurrency in LLM services. Traditional\nevaluation methods for LLM serving systems often rely on\nopen-source concurrency benchmarks. However, these methods\nare inadequate as they fail to consider the dynamic nature of\nuser interactions with LLMs and the resultant fluctuation in\njob submission rates. BurstGPT help users to utilize direct\nobservations of LLM workload to better replicate actual usage\npatterns. With BurstGPT, we can mirror various concurrency\nscenarios within the trace to assess the performance of the\nserving system across different scales.\n❶In the future, we would like to investigate resource and\nworkload scheduling based on BurstGPT. Workload provision-\ning is a crucial technique in cloud computing. The ability to\nelastically adjust system scale to match workload requirements\nis a significant challenge. Our future work involves collecting\nand analyzing BurstGPT’s usage patterns. We aim to apply\nmachine learning methods to predict and understand the\nvariations in LLM workloads.\n❷Moving forward, we will continue to record the starting\nand ending timestamps of prefilling and decoding for each\nrequest. This data will help us to thoroughly examine the\ninteraction between prefilling and decoding processes within\nthe serving systems under continuous batching conditions.\nVII. R ELATED WORK\nThis section provides an overview of essential techniques in\nLLM inference, including a focus on offline and online infer-\nence methodologies, key-value cache management strategies,\nand batching techniques.a) Online and Offline LLM services: LLM services\ncan be categorized into offline and online inference. Offline\ninference [ 36][37][38][39] refers to serving model inference in\na non-interactive manner. For example, users may need LLMs to\nprocess multiple requests concurrently, focusing on parallelism\nand maximum throughput. Conversely, as discussed in [ 5], [31],\n[36], online inference is characterized by real-time or interactive\nrequest processing, where QoS is critical. AlpaServe [ 5]\nimplements model parallelism and devising model-parallel\nplacements that align with request arrival patterns, aiming\nto optimize SLO fulfillment. Furthermore, FastServe [ 9] intro-\nduces an innovative skip-join MLFQ scheduler and employs\niteration-level preemption to enhance job completion efficiency.\nAdditionally, SpotServe [ 40] focuses on deploying LLM serving\nsystems on preemptive instances, striving for a balance between\ncosts and performance.\nBurstGPT is highlighted as the pioneering online inference\nserving workload for GPT services. In the future, we believe\nincorporating real-world workload considerations into the\nsystem design of both offline and online serving systems would\nsignificantly enhance their applicability and effectiveness.\nb) Key-Value Cache Management: In generative inference\nof GPT models, the inefficiency stems from recomputing\nkeys and values for each new token generated. The key-\nvalue (KV) cache was born and has since been studied in\nvarious studies[ 8], [38], [9], [36] to address this issue. The KV\ncache temporarily stores previously computed keys and values,\nenabling their reuse in successive iterations and thus eliminating\nthe need for redundant recomputation. Enhanced efficiency in\nKV cache utilization has been a focus of recent advancements.\nSpecifically, Flexgen [ 38] implements compression of both\nweights and KV cache to 4 bits, significantly expediting\ninference. FastServe [ 9], on the other hand, introduces a key-\nvalue cache management system to address memory overhead\nand reduce data transmission delays during computation.\nc) Workload Provisioning of Cloud Serving: In cloud\nenvironments, effective workload provisioning is essential\nfor scalable and flexible resource utilization, especially in\nadapting to varying demands. In the LLM serving, enhancing\nworkload provisioning is critical due to the high operational\ncosts. Current research in this area focuses on integrating load\nbalancing [ 41], auto-scaling [ 40], and predictive analysis to\neffectively respond to workload fluctuations [ 42]. In the future,\nby employing BurstGPT, researchers have the potential to\nleverage the inherent burstiness and user behavior patterns to\noptimize workload provisioning in future scenarios.\nVIII.

"How does GPT-4's USMLE performance compare to ChatGPT, and what does this mean for LLMs in med subspecialties?","['second pursues the development of a specialized medical\nLLM.\n3.1 Applying General-purpose LLMs to\nMedicine\nThe ascendancy of general-purpose LLMs [9, 6, 33, 10,\n34] has sparked significant interest in the medical field.\nRecent literature [59, 60, 61] has provided a comprehen-\nsive review of ChatGPT’s applications within health-\ncare and clinical practice. To gauge the capability of\nthese models, researchers frequently resort to bench-\nmark question-answering datasets spanning various med-\nical disciplines, utilizing metrics such as accuracy, re-\ncall, and F1 scores for assessment. OpenAI’s pivotal\nstudy [6] stands out, showcasing GPT-4’s commendable\nperformance on academic and professional tests tailored\nfor an erudite audience. The results pointed to GPT-\n4’s distinguished aptitude in subjects like the Uniform\nBar Exam and GRE. Furthermore, Microsoft’s indepen-\ndent analysis [70] placed GPT-4 above the USMLE, an\nexhaustive medical residents’ examination, marking a\nnotable improvement from its predecessor, ChatGPT,\nwhich merely matched college-level performance on the\nUSMLE [71, 72]. This progression epitomizes the brisk\nevolution of LLMs in medical settings.\nSubsequent research accentuates the adaptability of\ngeneral-purpose LLMs across diverse medical subspecial-\nties, ranging from oncology [11, 12, 73] to emergency\nmedicine [13], medical aesthetics [14], radiology [15], oph-\nthalmology [74, 75], surgery [76], and nursing [16]. These\ninquiries typically gauge an LLM’s domain-specific ex-\npertise using carefully curated questions. For example,\nHu et al. [75] evaluated GPT-4 by progressively introduc-\ning information on select ophthalmic conditions, simulat-\ning patient and physician interactions. Experienced oph-\nthalmologists subsequently assessed the model’s outputs,\nunderscoring GPT-4’s potential utility in both patient re-\nferrals and medical training. Additionally, Brin et al. [77]\nscrutinized both ChatGPT and GPT-4’s capabilities in\nhandling USMLE questions centered on communication\nnuances, ethics, and empathy, finding a noteworthy ca-\npacity for empathy and professionalism in AI.\nIn the realm of knowledge retrieval and dissemina-\ntion, LLMs emerge as potent instruments, serving not\nonly as invaluable repositories of medical information\nbut also as sophisticated educators. These models af-\nford healthcare professionals immediate access to con-\ntemporaneous medical data by meticulously analyzing\na plethora of scientific journals, research articles, and\nclinical protocols. This analysis furnishes pertinent\nand timely details [78, 60] pertaining to disease pro-\ncesses [79, 80], therapeutic approaches [81, 82, 21], and\ndrug interactions [83, 84]. Such insights can be espe-\ncially valuable in assisting with the diagnosis of rare\ndiseases [85], which often presents challenges for clini-cians. Furthermore, LLMs have the dexterity to democ-\nratize medical knowledge through online medical con-\nsultation [7, 85, 12, 86, 14, 87], ensuring widespread\navailability while simultaneously offering customization\nto cater to individual prerequisites, potentially impact-\ning telemedicine [61, 88].\nThe integration of LLMs in medical research and writ-\ning, as highlighted in various studies [89, 60, 17, 59, 90,\n91], significantly enhances the efficiency, equity, and ap-\nplicability of research endeavors. These models stream-\nline experimental design, ensure the preservation of pa-\ntient confidentiality through effective anonymization of\nmedical records, and augment the available medical text\ndata for training purposes. Notably, they facilitate the\nswift collection, processing, and sophisticated analysis of\ndisease-specific data, fostering more comprehensive and\ninsightful research initiatives. Clinical trials, an essential\ncomponent of medical research, benefit immensely from\nLLMs, as they address challenges related to patient-trial\nmatching and trial planning [92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 90]. A\ndetailed review by Ghim et al. [90] delves into the trans-\nformative potential of LLMs within clinical trials, iden-\ntifying five key areas for imminent implementation: im-\nproved patient-trial matching, streamlined clinical plan-\nning, advanced free text narrative analysis for coding\nand classification, assistance in technical trial planning,\nand the facilitation of informed consent through LLM-\npowered chatbots. In particular, Jin et al. [94] demon-\nstrated the capability of LLMs, through their proposed\nTrialGPT system, to aid patients and referral physicians\nin selecting appropriate clinical trials from a vast array,\nvalidating the explanatory prowess and invaluable con-\ntribution of LLMs to medical research on three public\ncohorts encompassing 184 patients and 18,238 annotated\nclinical trials.\nIn the context of clinical workflow, LLMs can signif-\nicantly mitigate the substantial burden shouldered by\nhealthcare professionals by autonomizing the documen-\ntation of patient information, clinical observations, and\ntest reports [17]. This automation does more than merely\nstreamline the process; it enhances both the accuracy\nand the thoroughness of the clinical documentation. For\nexample, LLMs have been efficaciously utilized to sum-\nmarize radiology reports [97], providing a prototype for\nanalogous applications in various domains [11], including\nusing ChatGPT to write patient clinic letters [98]. Be-\nsides, the deployment of LLMs in clinical decision sup-\nport is markedly beneficial, offering insightful recommen-\ndations pertaining to medication regimens, suggesting\nsuitable imaging services grounded in clinical presenta-\ntions, and enabling the astute diagnosis of diseases from\ncomprehensive clinical data sets [15]. When synergisti-\ncally integrated with other diagnostic instruments, such\nas medical imaging tools, LLMs proffer a more holistic\nperspective of patient health. Moreover, by analytically\nexamining data from analogous cases, LLMs can prog-\n5']","GPT-4's performance on the USMLE was notably better than ChatGPT's, which only matched college-level performance.

Why encode graph structure for molecule prediction with LLMs?,"['Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY Zhong et al.\nWhile LLMs have showcased their effectiveness across an array of NLP applications, the full extent of their potential\nin broader fields remains largely unexplored [ 46]. Notably, LLMs encounter challenges with structured data like graphs\nand often struggle with domain-specific inquiries, such as those in biology and chemistry [ 3,24]. To fill the gap, this\npaper delves into an essential research question: Can LLMs effectively handle molecule prediction tasks?\nTo answer this research question, this paper identifies different important tasks, including classification and regression\nprediction tasks, across six benchmark molecule datasets [ 22,42],e.g.,ogbg-molbace ,ogbg-molbbbp ,ogbg-molhiv ,\nogbg-molesol ,ogbg-molfreesolv andogbg-mollipo . Take a molecule, as illustrated in Figure 1, as an example, it\ncan be represented in different representations, including SMILES string [41] and geometric structure [46]. However, a\nnotable limitation of the existing LLMs is their reliance on unstructured text, rendering them unable to incorporate\nessential geometric structures as input [ 15,28]. To address this challenge, Fatemi et al . [12] propose encoding the\ngraph structure into text descriptions. In this paper, depicted in Figure 1, we extend this method by encoding both\nthe molecule’s atom features and graph structure into textual descriptions . Subsequently, we carefully design a set\nof prompts to harness various capabilities ( e.g., domain-expertise, ICL capability) of LLMs to generate responses for\nmolecule tasks. Then we evaluate these responses in terms of consistency and performance on downstream tasks and\ncompare them with those generated by existing ML models designed for molecule prediction tasks [19, 47].\nThe outcomes of our study effectively answered the raised question. Firstly, LLMs demonstrate a shortfall in\ncompetitive performance compared to existing ML models, particularly those specifically designed to capture the\ngeometric structure of molecules. While ICL techniques offer notable assistance in improving LLM performance, they\nstill trail behind existing ML models, underscoring the limited capability of current LLMs in directly addressing molecule\ntasks. Secondly, we delve into the potential of integrating LLM responses with existing ML models, observing significant\nenhancements in numerous scenarios. We posit that leveraging LLMs as augmenters of domain knowledge currently\npresents a more effective approach than tasking LLMs with directly answering molecule predictive tasks. In the end, we\ndeliver a series of insightful discussions about limitations and promising avenues of existing LLMs in molecule tasks.\nWe hope this work could shed new insight into the interdisciplinary framework design of molecule tasks empowered\nby LLMs.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. We begin by briefly reviewing related work in Section 2. Afterwards,\nin Section 3, we introduce the preliminaries of this study and include methodologies for molecule prediction tasks.\nExperimental results are shown in Section 4. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future work and conclude the paper\nin Section 5.\n2 RELATED WORK\nLarge Language Models . Traditional language models are typically trained on sequences of tokens, learning the\nlikelihood of the next token dependent on the previous tokens [ 38]. Recently, Brown et al . [4] demonstrated that\nincreasing the size of language models and the amount of training data can result in new capabilities, such as zero-shot\ngeneralisation, where models can perform text-based tasks without specific task-oriented training data. Consequently,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 [ 4], GPT-4 [ 32], Flan-T5 [ 8], Galactica [ 35], Llama [ 37] and Gemini [ 36],\nhave experienced exponential growth in both size and capability in recent years [ 1]. A wide range of NLP applications\nhave been reshaped by LLMs, including machine translation [ 18], commonsense reasoning [ 26] and coding tasks [ 5].\nWhile the impressive performance and generalisation capabilities of language models have rendered them highly\neffective across various tasks [ 39], they have also resulted in larger model parameters and increased computational costs\nfor additional fine-tuning on new downstream tasks [ 20].

How does updating LLM in text games cut human annotations?,"['Language Model-In-The-Loop: Data Optimal Approach to\nLearn-To-Recommend Actions in Text Games\nArjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar1,2, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Janarthanan Rajendran1,3, Sarath Chandar1,2,4\n1Mila - Quebec AI Institute\n2Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal\n3University of Montreal\n4Canada CIFAR AI Chair\narjun.vaithilingam-sudhakar@mila.quebec\nAbstract\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demon-\nstrated superior performance in language un-\nderstanding benchmarks. CALM, a popular\napproach, leverages linguistic priors of LLMs—\nGPT-2—for action candidate recommendations\nto improve the performance in text games in\nJericho without environment-provided actions.\nHowever, CALM adapts GPT-2 with annotated\nhuman gameplays and keeps the LLM fixed\nduring the learning of the text based games.\nIn this work, we explore and evaluate updat-\ning LLM used for candidate recommendation\nduring the learning of the text based game as\nwell to mitigate the reliance on the human an-\nnotated gameplays, which are costly to acquire.\nWe observe that by updating the LLM during\nlearning using carefully selected in-game tran-\nsitions, we can reduce the dependency on using\nhuman annotated game plays for fine-tuning\nthe LLMs. We conducted further analysis to\nstudy the transferability of the updated LLMs\nand observed that transferring in-game trained\nmodels to other games did not result in a con-\nsistent transfer.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language models (Devlin et al., 2019a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018b; Ouyang et al., 2022) (LLMs)\ntrained on large corpora of unstructured text cor-\npora are the state-of-the-art models in several Nat-\nural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks.\nBender and Koller (2020) argue in their position\npaper that the models trained largely from static\nbenchmarks rely to the form rather than understand-\ning the meaning. While it is imperative to un-\nderstand the learning dynamics of LLMs (Rogers\net al., 2020; Webson and Pavlick, 2021), intro-\nducing novel language understanding challenges\npushes the frontiers for LLMs’ applications. There\nhas been a recent interest in interactive training of\nlarge language models in situated learning environ-\nments. Bisk et al. (2020); McClelland et al. (2020)\nFigure 1: Sample gameplay from zork1 game in Jericho\nusing LM for action recommendation: LM recommends\naction candidates based on the observation from env.\nThe RL agent selects an action from the candidates.\npoint out the necessity for LMs to have enhanced\nlanguage understanding and meaning through in-\nteracting with the physical world. Also, Lake and\nMurphy (2021) argues that LMs fall short in their\ncommunicative usage, requiring reasoning over in-\ntents despite their success in static datasets.\nTraining decision making agents over tex-\ntual information for playing text-based games\n(Hausknecht et al., 2020; C ˆot´e et al., 2018) has been\na recent usecase for LLM. While decision mak-\ning has been the front of text-game playing, such\ngames introduce novel challenges for language un-\nderstanding, and domain adaptation for LLMs. Yao\net al. (2020) used GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2018b) to\ngenerate candidate actions for the decision making\nDRRN module (He et al., 2016) in Jericho bench-\nmark of text based games. Such a set up allows\nfor qualitatively understanding the LLMs’ abilities\ntounderstand ,reason , and adapt to novel situa-\ntions.

How do ChatGPT and GPT-4 differ in false recommendation rates for second-order deception?,"['9 \n behavior in few cases ( false recommendation: 11.67%, χ² = 141.07 , p < .001; false label: 62.08%, χ² = \n14.02, p < .001). ChatGPT, in particular, seems to “mistake” the second -order deception tasks ( false \nrecommendation: 5.83%, χ² = 187.27 , p < .001; false label: 3.33%, χ² = 209.07 , p < .001) with their easier \nfirst-order counterparts. While engaging in the additional mentalizing loop required for the tasks (“Agent \nX told you that  agent Y knows that you plan to trick him ”), LLMs often seem to lose track of which item \nis in which place.  \nIn sum, the experiments indicate that in state -of-the-art GPT models, the ability to deceive other agents \nemerged. However, this ability only pertains to simple, first -order deception tasks. Moreover, when \nengaging in comprehensive reasoning about deceptio n tasks during prompt completion, LLMs often fail \nto reliably track the correct position of items throughout the token generation process. Even in view of \nsuch shortcomings, though, it is to be expected that future LLMs will be able to engage more precisel y in \ndeep mentalizing loops as well as solve deception problems with increasing complexities.  \n3.3 Can deception abilities be improve d? \nConsidering the LLMs’  trouble in dealing with complex deception tasks, we wonder whether techniques \nto increase reasoning abilities in LLMs can help in dealing with these tasks. LLMs possess two spaces in \nwhich they can engage in reasoning. It takes place in the internal representations of the models themselves  \nplus in the prompt completion process given a comprehensive enough token output  is triggered . This can \nbe achieved by chain -of-thought prompting, which elicits long prompt completions, divide s tasks into \nsteps, and ultimately increases reasoning performance in LLMs (Wei et al. 2022b; Kojima et al. 2022) . In \npractice, this serialization of reasoning processes is done by suffixing prompts with “Let’s think step by \nstep.” Based  on this finding, we select the two most capable models from our previous tests, namely \nChatGPT and GPT -4, and test whether their deception performance increases by eliciting multi -step \nreasoning. We suffix all items with “Let’s think step by step about the intentions, beliefs, and knowledge \nof all individuals involved in this task” and compare the new results to the original study  (see Figure 4; \nsee Appendix C  for examples ). The r esults show that in both second -order deception tasks, ChatGPT \ndoes not become significantly  better  (false recommendation:  5.83% vs. 3.33%, χ² = 2.73, p = 0.1; false \nlabel: 3.33% vs. 3.75%, χ² = 0.13, p = 0.72). GPT-4, on the other hand, increase s its performance at least \nin false recommendation tasks (false recommendation:  11.67% vs. 70%, χ² = 792.45 , p < .001; false label: \n62.08% vs. 72.92%, χ² = 11.97, p < .001). This shows that powerful models can even deal with complex \ndeception scenarios, given they are prompted to reason about them step  by step. However, similar to the \nprevious base tests, LLMs tend to sometimes  fail to reliably track which item s belong to which position  \nthroughout their reasoning process . \n ']","ChatGPT does not become significantly better in false recommendation rates for second-order deception tasks (5.83% vs. 3.33%, χ² = 2.73, p = 0.1).

Figure 8(b) shows that a majority\nof the participants felt that the GPT-3.5 model was Somewhat Helpful to them in writing a better story. Among these,\nAF reported that “The AI had its strengths, but its ideas didn’t resonate with me personally. They didn’t speak to my life\nexperience"" . Amongst participants who found GPT-3.5 to be Mostly Helpful , ES said “It is helpful in identifying logical\ninconsistencies, providing technical feedback, even if very common notes, it is most helpful as an editing tool rather than as\nan idea generator, which is probably for the best anyway. Its creativity also depends on my ability to be more specific in\nmy prompts, so the more I give it the better job it can do. . MC added to it by saying “ In general the AI is much better at\nexposition than scene work"" . However, 21.4% of participants found GPT-3.5 to be Hardly Helpful . This was primarily\ndue to GPT-3.5 being trite and unoriginal in most of its suggestions. In their feedback, SH said “The AI tends to lean\nincredibly cliché, which is understandable given what it is, but as a tool for a writer, this is often a trap more than it is\nhelpful.” . NM found the experience to be frustrating, “It mostly felt as though I was fighting against the AI to produce\nwhat I wanted, instead of the AI helping me.”\n6.5 In your opinion, what are the main weaknesses of the AI system in this collaborative writing setting?\nOur participants provided detailed feedback highlighting several concerns and drawbacks that prevent contemporary\nLLMs from being effective at creativity support. To consolidate these weaknesses and develop a taxonomy, we use a\ngeneral inductive approach for analyzing qualitative data [ 54]. Following this method, three authors independently read\nall of the measures and assigned each measure an initial potential low-level group. Then, through repeated discussion,\nthe researchers reduced category overlap and created shared low-level groups associated. Finally, these low-level\ngroups were collected into high-level groups and a name was proposed for each group that encapsulates a generalized\nrepresentation of the weakness. These weaknesses span across 4 broad categories. These categories highlighted AI’s a)\nRepetitiveness b) Reliance on Cliches and Tropes c) Lack of Nuance/Subtext or Symbolism, and d) Suggestion of overly\nMoralistic and Predictable Endings. Table 8 showcases feedback on the weakness of AI across these 4 broad categories.\n6.6 As a writer collaborating with an AI system, what specific capabilities or features do you think would\nenhance your writing experience?\nWhile existing models might not yet be capable enough to act as a helpful creativity support tool, we asked our\nparticipants what capabilities or features would enhance their writing experience. Most participants hoped for a model\nthat would generate innovative surprising text free of cliches. Amongst others, SH said “When it comes to imagery, one\nthing that is often discussed in the practice of writing is that strange images, strange descriptions, are much more effective\nthan cliché. This seems like something the AI could be particularly good at, drawing unrelated things together to describe\nexperiences in fun and new and interesting ways. ” MG wanted the model to “point out where she had labored the point and\nmade it too obvious and not clever enough and where she had gone on for too long in thought or dialogue from a character\nand to show what exactly needs to be cut or condensed at a sentence level to improve the readability.” ES hoped the AI to\nbecome a more nuanced prose writer, and be trained to write stories with different writing styles. Finally, RH wanted to\nsee variation in sentence structure, “On a more granular level, a well-written piece of modern literary fiction would likely\ncontain variations of sentence structure (list-like clauses, gerunds, etc.) that I haven’t yet seen produced by AI.”\nOverall, the feedback from participants highlights the potential pitfalls of current large language models as a creativity\nsupport tool and facilitates future research direction in creative writing assistance.\n19']","AI's four main weaknesses in collaborative writing are: a) Repetitiveness, b) Reliance on Cliches and Tropes, c) Lack of Nuance/Subtext or Symbolism, and d) Suggestion of overly Moralistic and Predictable Endings.",reasoning,"[{'page_label': '19', 'file_name': '2309.12570v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2309.12570v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4190233, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

We have already seen that in-context imperson-\nation boosts performance and produces biases; these results could be followed up by investigating\nhow these characteristics emerge during training, change with increasing model size [ 87], or adapt\nwith additional fine-tuning [ 88]. Additionally, LLM providers could quantitatively test for these\nbiases before releasing new models. We specifically discourage crafting (system) prompts for maxi-\nmal performance by exploiting biases, as this may have unexpected side effects, reinforce societal\nbiases and poison training data obtained with such prompts. Other misuses may include amplifica-\ntion of stereotypical biases through generated content and using impersonation to invoke fake trust.\nHowever, we believe systematically studying these biases raises awareness in the ML community\nand general society and serves as a first step to research mitigation strategies. Lastly, we discuss\nlimitations of our work in suppl. Section E.\n6 Conclusion\nWe presented evidence that in-context impersonation , that is asking LLMs to take on different roles\nin context, can change their performance and reveal their biases. Asking LLMs to impersonate\ndifferently aged people in a two-armed bandit task, LLMs could reproduce human-like developmen-\ntal stages of exploration behavior.

How do jailbreaks bypass safeguards and threaten LLMs?,"['Preprint\nsome desired behavior and accordingly propose a new framework for fine-tuning LLMs to approx-\nimate any target distribution through f-divergences minimization. In addition to aligning LLMs in\nthe fine-tuning stage, Korbak et al. (2023) propose pertaining LLMs with alternative objectives that\nguide them to generate text aligned with human preferences and significantly reduce the rate of\ngenerating undesirable content by using conditional training (Keskar et al., 2019).\nAlignment-breaking Attacks and defenses in LLMs Although various alignment strategies have\nbeen developed to steer LLMs to generate content complying with human ethical principles, an\nemerging class of alignment-breaking attacks (i.e., jailbreak attacks) can still bypass safeguards and\nelicit LLMs to generate harmful and toxic responses (Wolf et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Shen et al.,\n2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023), which poses significant threats to the\npractical deployment of LLMs. In particular, inspired by traditional computer security, Kang et al.\n(2023) adapt obfuscation, code injection/payload splitting, and visualization attacks to the LLMs,\nleading to the generation of content containing hate speech, phishing attacks, and scams. Wei et al.\n(2023) hypothesize that competing objectives and mismatched generalization are two failure modes\nof safety training in LLMs and craft effective jailbreak attacks by leveraging the two failure modes.\nInstead of manually crafting adversarial prompts, Zou et al. (2023) automatically produce trans-\nferable adversarial suffixes by using greedy and gradient-based search methods to maximize the\nprobability of generating an affirmative response. Yuan et al. (2023) bypass the safety alignment\nthrough dialogue encryption. Shen et al. (2023) systematically analyzes the characteristics of jail-\nbreak prompts in the wild and presents that jailbreak prompts have evolved to be more stealthy and\neffective with reduced length, increased toxicity, and semantic shift. Note that some concurrent\nworks also aim to defend against alignment-breaking attacks: Kumar et al. (2023) provides a veri-\nfiable safety guarantee by enumerating all possible partially erased input and using a safety filter to\nidentify the harmfulness of the input content. Jain et al. (2023) propose to detect adversarial prompts\nby checking if the perplexity of the prompt is greater than a threshold.\nTraditional Text Adversarial Attack and Defenses Traditional text adversarial attacks primarily\nfocus on text classification tasks and aim to force target models to maximize their prediction error\nby adversarially perturbing original text (Ebrahimi et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018; Ma-\nheshwary et al., 2021; Ye et al., 2023). The adversarial perturbation could be crafted by performing\ncharacter-level transformation (Gao et al., 2018) or replacing original words with their synonyms\nwhile maintaining semantics and syntax similar (Alzantot et al., 2018). The generation of adversar-\nial examples could be categorized into the “white-box” setting and the “black-box” setting according\nto the extent of access to the target model (Xu et al., 2020a). As a representative white-box method,\nHotFlip (Ebrahimi et al., 2017) uses the gradient information of discrete text structure at its one-hot\nrepresentation to construct adversarial examples. In the black-box setting, Li et al. (2018); Jin et al.\n(2020); Ren et al. (2019) leverage the prediction score distribution on all categories to craft adversar-\nial text without the guidance of parameter gradients. Maheshwary et al. (2021) focus on a more re-\nalistic scenario where attackers only know the top- 1prediction and propose using population-based\noptimization to construct adversarial text. Ye et al. (2022) follow the same scenario and employ the\nword embedding space to guide the generation of adversarial examples.\nTo defend against adversarial attacks, a body of empirical defense methods has been proposed.\nIn particular, adversarial-training-based methods (Miyato et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2019) incorpo-\nrate adversarial perturbations to word embeddings and robustly train the model by minimizing the\nadversarial loss. Zhou et al. (2021); Dong et al. (2021) utilize adversarial data augmentation by\nreplacing the original word with its synonyms to make the model robust to similar adversarial per-\nturbations. These methods gain empirical success against adversarial attacks. To provide provable\nrobustness against adversarial word substitutions, Jia et al. (2019) use certifiably robust training by\ntraining the model to optimize Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) upper bound. Shi et al. (2020)\nadopt linear-relaxation-based perturbation analysis (Xu et al., 2020c) to develop a robustness ver-\nification method for transformers. Zeng et al. (2023) propose a certifiably robust defense method\nbased on randomized smoothing techniques (Cohen et al., 2019).\n3 O URPROPOSED METHOD\nIn this section, we introduce the proposed Robustly Aligned LLM for defending alignment-breaking\nattacks.

Case Study\nWe also show the results of real-life examples by applying\nour Formal-LLM to the GPT models. Due to the page limit,\nwe put the complete results in the Appendix.\nFrom our observation, after applying our Formal-LLM, the\ngenerated plan from the GPT-based agent is more complete,\nreasonable and specific to the case. In the daily plan ex-\nample, the agent fails to fit all the activities into the plan\nwithout the Formal-LLM, while it can achieve this goal by\napplying the Formal-LLM. Still take Figure 4 as an exam-\nple, our Formal-LLM framework can limit the planning to\n10:00∼20:00, while without Formal-LLM, the agent sched-\nules activities after 20:00, even if we mention the constraint\n“Generate a plan for all the activities between 10:00 and\n20:00 ” in natural language, which shows the advantages of\nformal language guided planning. For the cooking recipe\nexample, without strict automaton constraint, GPT may gen-\nerate steps such as “ stir-fry the Chinese broccoli until it\nchanges color ” after “ once the water boils, add the Chinese\nbroccoli ”. This is unreasonable because it’s impossible to\nstir-fry when broccoli is in boiling water. As for the risk\nmanagement example, the generated plan without our frame-\nwork is too general that it could be used for any other two\ncompanies. However, the plan after applying Formal-LLMis more specific and focuses on the potential antitrust risk\nbetween Microsoft and Blizzard. Thus, after applying the\nautomaton which describes the constraints, the generated\nplan has better quality under the Formal-LLM framework.\n6. Conclusions and Future Work\nIn this study, we introduce the innovative Formal-LLM\nframework for LLM-based agents, combining LLM’s power\nof natural language comprehension with the precision of for-\nmal language. Our experiments, encompassing benchmark\ntasks and real-life practical scenarios, affirm the feasibil-\nity and effectiveness of employing automaton to control\nthe agent’s generation of valid plans. More controllable\nLLM-based agents can augment the potential utilization of\nLLM in applications where high validity of planning holds\nsignificant importance.\nSeveral potential extensions to our work merit considera-\ntion. First, automating the translation of natural language\ninto formal language for agents could further improve the\nframework, as designing formal language and automata by\ndomain experts may not be the most efficient approach. Ad-\nditionally, this work focuses on LLM plan generation based\non formal language; however, another important problem to\nexplore in the future is LLM plan verification based on for-\nmal language. Furthermore, our framework uses one large\nautomaton to control the whole planning process, while an-\nother potential solution is to use multiple small automata,\neach describing one constraint, and the agent only accesses\nthe corresponding one when needed during plan generation.\n8']","F-LLM boosts plan validity and task performance in LLM agents by integrating the benefits of both natural and formal languages, leading to more controllable and valid planning.

"Why do GNNs excel over LLMs in large, well-annotated datasets?","['Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nout the requirement for any labeled data. However, unlike GNNs, LLMs cannot naturally capture\nand understand informative graph structural patterns (Wang et al., 2023a). Moreover, LLMs can\nnot be well-tuned since they can only utilize limited labels due to the limitation of input context\nlength (Dong et al., 2022). Thus, though LLMs can achieve promising performance in zero-shot\nor few-shot scenarios, there may still be a performance gap between LLMs and GNNs trained with\nabundant labeled nodes (Chen et al., 2023). Furthermore, the prediction cost of LLMs is much\nhigher than that of GNNs, making it less scalable for large datasets such as O GBN-ARXIV and\nOGBN-PRODUCTS (Hu et al., 2020b).\nIn summary, we make two primary observations: (1) Given adequate annotations with high qual-\nity, GNNs excel in utilizing graph structures to provide predictions both efficiently and effectively.\nNonetheless, limitations can be found when adequate high-quality annotations are absent. (2) In\ncontrast, LLMs can achieve satisfying performance without high-quality annotations while being\ncostly. Considering these insights, it becomes evident that GNNs and LLMs possess complemen-\ntary strengths. This leads us to an intriguing question: Can we harness the strengths of both while\naddressing their inherent weaknesses?\nIn this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to the above question by investigating the potential\nof harnessing the zero-shot learning capabilities of LLMs to alleviate the substantial training data\ndemands of GNNs, a scenario we refer to as label-free node classification . Notably, unlike the\ncommon assumption that ground truth labels are always available, noisy labels can be found when\nannotations are generated from LLMs. We thus confront a unique challenge: How can we ensure\nthe high quality of the annotation without sacrifice diversity and representativeness? On one hand,\nwe are required to consider the design of appropriate prompts to enable LLMs to produce more\naccurate annotations. On the other hand, we need to strategically choose a set of training nodes that\nnot only possess high-quality annotations but also exhibit informativeness and representativeness, as\nprior research has shown a correlation between these attributes and the performance of the trained\nmodel (Huang et al., 2010).\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a label-free node classification on graphs with LLMs\npipeline, LLM-GNN. Different from traditional graph active node selection (Wu et al., 2019; Cai\net al., 2017), LLM-GNN considers the node annotation difficulty by LLMs to actively select nodes.\nThen, it utilizes LLMs to generate confidence-aware annotations and leverages the confidence score\nto further refine the quality of annotations as post-filtering. By seamlessly blending annotation\nquality with active selection, LLM-GNN achieves impressive results at a minimal cost, eliminating\nthe necessity for ground truth labels. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1. We introduce a new label-free pipeline LLM-GNN to leverage LLMs for annotation, providing\ntraining signals on GNN for further prediction.\n2. We adopt LLMs to generate annotations with calibrated confidence, and introduce difficulty-\naware active selection with post filtering to get training nodes with a proper trade-off between\nannotation quality and traditional graph active selection criteria.\n3. On the massive-scale O GBN-PRODUCTS dataset, LLM-GNN can achieve 74.9% accuracy with-\nout the need for human annotations. This performance is comparable to manually annotating 400\nrandomly selected nodes, while the cost of the annotation process via LLMs is under 1 dollar .\n2 P RELIMINARIES\nIn this section, we introduce text-attributed graphs and notation utilized in our study. We then review\ntwo primary pipelines on node classification. The first pipeline is the default node classification\npipeline to evaluate the performance of GNNs (Kipf & Welling, 2016), while it totally ignores the\ndata selection process. The second pipeline further emphasizes the node selection process, trying\nto identify the most informative nodes as training sets to maximize the model performance within a\ngiven budget.\nOur study focuses on Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) , represented as GT= (V,A,T,X).V=\n{v1,···, vn}is the set of nnodes paired with raw attributes T={t1,t2, . . . ,tn}. Each text\nattributes can then be encoded as sentence embedding X={x1,x2, . . . ,xn}with the help of Sen-\ntenceBERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). The adjacency matrix A∈ {0,1}n×nrepresents graph\nconnectivity where A[i, j] = 1 indicates an edge between nodes iandj. Although our study puts\nmore emphasis on TAGs, it has the potential to be extended to more types of graphs through methods\nlike Liu et al. (2023) and Zhao et al. (2023).\n2']","GNNs excel over LLMs in large, well-annotated datasets because they can utilize graph structures to provide predictions both efficiently and effectively when given adequate high-quality annotations.",reasoning,"[{'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '2310.04668v3.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/alexmavr/Repos/verbis/script/../arxiv_papers/2310.04668v3.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1027111, 'creation_date': '2024-06-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-27'}]",True

How does soft prompt-tuning aid patient info extraction in clinical NLP?,"['types of prompt shapes including (1) “hard prompts” (or discrete prompts) – a piece of text composed by researchers providing information about the target prediction, and (2) “soft prompts” (or continuous prompts) – a continuous vector (of virtual tokens) attached to the input.  To adopt LLMs for specific downstream applications, researchers either adopt the traditional fine-tuning to keep updating the pretrained LLMs – known as “model-tuning”, or to freeze the LLMs and only update the soft prompts – known as “prompt-tuning” or “p-tuning”.[6]  Most studies in clinical NLP focus on hard prompts as ChatGPT adopted this strategy and achieved a breakthrough in conversational AI.  However, designing hard prompts is very labor-intensive, and recent studies have shown that LLMs are very sensitive to hard prompts.  Therefore, many recent studies started exploring prompt-tuning using soft prompts. Prompt-tuning offers many benefits over model-tuning, especially in reducing the computing and memory costs as LLMs are frozen during the fine-tuning.  Another important benefit of freezing LLMs in prompt-tuning is that we can deploy one single LLM for multiple tasks in the real-world healthcare applications.  However, early-stage studies on prompt-tuning using smaller LLMs have shown that freezing LLMs often does not yield good performance that is competitive with model-tuning.  Most recently, several studies further explored prompt-tuning and demonstrated promising results by scaling up the model size to exceed billions of parameters.   LLMs have many potentials in medical research and healthcare.  An important application of clinical NLP is patient information extraction from clinical narratives. Clinical concept extraction (or named entity recognition [NER]) and relation extraction (RE) are two fundamental NLP tasks for patient information extraction.[7]  Various solutions, including rule-based [8–10]  traditional machine learning-based models, [11–14] and deep learning model [15–17] have been developed ', 'INTRODUCTION Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have almost become standard solutions for clinical natural language processing.  In the recent decade, the natural language processing (NLP) community has witnessed a dramatic change from fully supervised learning architecture – where the “one model per task” strategy was adopted and all model parameters were tuned (i.e., updated) during training, to pretraining/fine-tuning architecture – where one pretrained LLM can be adapted to various NLP tasks through fine-tuning, and eventually to prompt-based learning architecture [1]  – where a prompt was attached to the input to condition the output on not only model parameters but also prompts.  Prompt-based learning offers many advantages including better few-shot, zero-shot, and transfer learning ability as well as the freedom to control model output using prompts, which is a key technology in achieving conversational artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT. [1–3]  At present, the performance of prompt-based learning highly depends on (1) the “shape” of the prompts, i.e., hard/discrete prompts (in clear text) or soft/continuous prompts, and (2) algorithms to adopt LLMs for downstream tasks. Currently, there are two strategies to fine-tune LLMs for downstream tasks, including “model-tuning” – updating LLMs parameters in training, or “prompt-tuning” – updating soft prompts while keeping LLMs frozen.  Prompt-tuning with frozen LLMs offers many benefits over model-tuning including (1) enabling machines to learn “soft prompts” to unload researchers from labor-intensive prompt engineering (i.e., human manually compose hard prompts using clear text), and (2) reducing computing cost by keeping LLMs frozen; and (3) enabling one model for multiple downstream tasks to greatly reduce the development and deployment cost.  Nevertheless, most existing works in prompt-based clinical NLP are based on hard prompts using model-tuning; there is a lack of studies exploring the use of soft prompts and prompt-tuning algorithms.
